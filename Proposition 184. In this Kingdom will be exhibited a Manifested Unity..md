>This is positively predicted, not only in reference to the Jews (Isa. 11:13; Ezek. 37:18-22, etc., excluding all envy, division, etc.), bat in reference to the Gentiles, all being embraced in one great universal Kingdom to which all render obedience and homage (as e.g. Dan. 7:14, 27; Zech. 14:9, 16; Micah 4:1-7, etc.). A Theocracy so extended and realized, in the nature of the case, cannot tolerate disunion; and under the rule of the supernaturally endowed King and His co-rulers all tendencies to separation, dissent and discord will be effectually crushed.
### No full present unity
Obs. 1
>The condition of the Church down to the harvest, a mingling of tares and wheat, good and bad fish, foolish and wise virgins, forbids the attainment of a manifested unity however desirable to man and acceptable to God, seeing that such a mixture itself—allowed for purposes of mercy—is productive of diversity.

>Obs. 2

>It is a painful fact that we have large and small bodies of professing believers, who, discarding a common religious experience, make their own church or sect the exemplification of the Biblical idea of unity, and therefore either ignore the professions of all others, refusing to allow them to be also believers, or else, while theoretically conceding that they may be Christians, practically refuse them the title by debarring them from the Lord’s table, etc.
>Obs. 2
### Christianity is unreliable
>Obs. 3. Infidels may parade the differences, the antagonisms, and even the hostility of the various churches, and from this deduce the unreliability of Christianity, because a unity, which they assert is promised, is not manifested;
