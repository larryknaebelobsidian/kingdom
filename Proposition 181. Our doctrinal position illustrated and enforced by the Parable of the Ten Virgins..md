# Proposition 181. Our doctrinal position illustrated and enforced by the Parable of the Ten Virgins.

### Props Mentioned
121 130 166 169
### The attitude of the Church at the Sec. Advent
>... illustrative of the attitude of the Church at the Sec. Advent.
>p. 299 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 1

>The context, therefore, as well as the parable, enforces the importance and duty of watchfulness and faithfulness.
>p. 299 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 1
### Not the destruction of Jerusalem in 70AD
>Obs. 2. The application of it, therefore, to the Romans at the destruction of Jerusalem, to death, to divine providence, etc., is foreign to the intent of the parable.
>p. 299 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 2
### Parabolic form must be constantly observed
>Obs. 3. In the interpretation of the parable, its parabolic form must constantly be observed; and hence not every particular expression, introduced to fill out the figure or image introduced, is to be pressed to denote a corresponding relationship in the Church or future.
>p. 300 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 3
### Prophetic
>Obs. 4. This parable is prophetic, being designed to express and enforce the future unexpected (because not exactly known) Coming of the great Bridegroom, the certainty of that Coming although delayed, the condition of certain parties at His Advent, and the result to themselves arising from the state in which they are found.
>p. 300 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 4
### Familiar custom
>The custom from whence the parable is taken, was one familiar to the East. Jesus selects a particular time in the marriage ceremonial, to illustrate the uncertainty of His Coming, and the consequences of heeding or not heeding the, cautions He already had given respecting it. It is the time *after* the wedding at the house of the bride’s parents (Horne’s *Introd.*, vol. 2, p. 161, Barnes’s *Com. loci*, Lisco’s *On the Parables*, p. 183, *Encyclop. Relig. Knowl.*, art. “Mar. Ceremony,” Smith’s *Dic. Bible*, Meyer’s *Com.* etc.), and *after* the wedding festival there (which lasted several days—we are told seven for a maid and three for a widow), when the bridegroom, with the nuptial guests, conducts the bride to his own house or to that of his father, that is chosen. The procession generally started in the evening or night with great pomp, having torches, songs, and music. This company with the bridegroom, was met by another, friends of the bridegroom and bride, which, at or near the bridegroom’s house, waited, ready at the first notice of approach to go forth, meet the procession, unite with it, enter the house, and participate in the entertainment or marriage supper. This last company not knowing precisely the hour or time when the procession would come, made preparation and watched for its arrival, so that it could enter in with the bridal party—its union with the other and privilege of admittance, being indicated by the bearing of lamps, or burning torches, thus showing that they were friends, and as such could properly be admitted as guests at the marriage feast. After the procession entered the house with those who actually participated in the escort and manifested their friendship and respect for the bridegroom and bride, the door was shut and admittance refused. Now Jesus takes this parabolic representation from actual life, and shows from *the uncertainty* of the bridegroom’s arrival and *the preparedness* of the company awaiting him, *how* it will be (as the word “then” implies) at His future Advent, and, consequently, enjoins watchfulness.
>p. 301 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 5
### Agreement with all other predictions is required
>Obs. 6. The parable being *prophetic*, and thus delineating what shall truly take place *when* the Lord Jesus shall return from the wedding, it must accord fully, be in perfect agreement, with all the other predictions relating to the subject.
>p. 302 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 6

>... it must correspond not merely to the general statements on the subject, but to the exact order of fulfilment pertaining to that future period.
>p. 302 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 6

>Thus it has been shown (Prop. 130) that the Second Advent, like the First, is expressive of a period of years; that its beginning is characterized by a thief-like, concealed Coming and its end by an open Advent. The question, therefore, is *with which stage* of the Advent does the parable best correspond? To this there can be but one answer: it pertains to the last stage, the open parousia.
>p. 302 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 6

### Storyline of this parable
#### Takes place after the wedding
#### Starts at the house of the bride's parents
#### After the wedding festival (7 days) at the bride's parents house
#### Groom and nuptial guests escort the bride and groom to the bridegroom's house (or his parents)
#### Escort starts at night with pomp, torches, songs, music
#### Escort meets another group (friends of the bride and groom) who have been waiting for the groom and bride, to enter the feast at the groom's house
#### Some who are waiting have run out of oil and must go buy some oil
#### After bride and groom arrive with their guests, the guests went in, the door was shut and no one else was admitted (the one's who had to go buy some oil did not make it in)

***Note how Peters' view is that the 144,000 are withdrawn and taken to Mt. Sinai as the first and hidden stage of the Second Advent of Christ.  The parable of the ten virgins does not refer to this activity according to Peters.***
### Not the bride but guests
>... these virgins join the procession *on the return of the bridegroom with the bride* to their future abode (Obs. 5 and note). This accords with the previous withdrawal of the 144,000 (Prop. 130), with the Theocratic marriage at Mt. Sinai (Prop. 166), and with the procession of the bridegroom and bride to their future glorious abode on Mt. Zion. This agrees with the simple fact that these virgins, prepared to unite and enter into the marriage supper, are, *not the bride, but guests* who honor the bridegroom and the bride—virgins who follow the queen.
>p. 305 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 8
### What will happen to certain parties
>... the parable is expressly designed to illustrate what will occur, in relation to certain parties, at its realization.
>p. 305 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 9
### Foolish, excluded from festivities, but ultimately saved
>The foolish, therefore, are only excluded from these marriage festivities, but will ultimately be saved.
>p. 306 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 11
### Exclusion
>Obs. 12. The “door being shut” and the declaration “I know you not,” are, therefore, simply expressive of exclusion *to a position* which the others, because of their preparation and readiness, obtain.
>p. 306 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 12
### No conversion of the world prior to the Sec. Advent
>Obs. 15. The parable enforces our position that there will be no conversion of the world prior to the Sec. Advent.
>p. 308 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 15
### Watch and be prepared
>Obs. 16. No matter whether this parable be interpreted as applying to the Church at the first stage of the Sec. Advent, or to the same at the last stage, or to the Jews at the open, manifested parousia as distinguished from the previous thief-like Coming, it corroborates and enforces our doctrine respecting the attitude of watchfulness and preparation for the Sec. Advent, the certainty and personality of that Coming, and the blessed results flowing to the righteous from that Advent.
>p. 308 Vol. 3 Prop. 181 Obs. 16
