>Obs. 4. This parable is prophetic, being designed to express and enforce the future unexpected (because not exactly known) Coming of the great Bridegroom, the certainty of that Coming although delayed, the condition of certain parties at His Advent, and the result to themselves arising from the state in which they are found.

>The custom from whence the parable is taken, was one familiar to the East. Jesus selects a particular time in the marriage ceremonial, to illustrate the uncertainty of His Coming, and the consequences of heeding or not heeding the, cautions He already had given respecting it. It is the time after the wedding at the house of the bride’s parents (Horne’s Introd., vol. 2, p. 161, Barnes’s Com. loci, Lisco’s On the Parables, p. 183, Encyclop. Relig. Knowl., art. “Mar. Ceremony,” Smith’s Die. Bible, Meyer’s Com. etc.), and after the wedding festival there (which lasted several days—we are told seven for a maid and three for a widow), when the bridegroom, with the nuptial guests, conducts the bride to his own house or to that of his father, that is chosen. The procession generally started in the evening or night with great pomp, having torches, songs, and music. This company with the bridegroom, was met by another, friends of the bridegroom and bride, which, at or near the bridegroom’s house, waited, ready at the first notice of approach to go forth, meet the procession, unite with it, enter the house, and participate in the entertainment or marriage supper. This last company not knowing precisely the hour or time when the procession would come, made preparation and watched for its arrival, so that it could enter in with the bridal party—its union with the other and privilege of admittance, being indicated by the bearing of lamps, or burning torches, thus showing that they were friends, and as such could properly be admitted as guests at the marriage feast. After the procession entered the house with those who actually participated in the escort and manifested their friendship and respect for the bridegroom and bride, the door was shut and admittance refused.
