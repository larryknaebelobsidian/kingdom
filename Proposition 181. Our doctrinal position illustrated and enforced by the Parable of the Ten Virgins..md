>Obs. 4. This parable is prophetic, being designed to express and enforce the future unexpected (because not exactly known) Coming of the great Bridegroom, the certainty of that Coming although delayed, the condition of certain parties at His Advent, and the result to themselves arising from the state in which they are found.

>The custom from whence the parable is taken, was one familiar to the East. Jesus selects a particular time in the marriage ceremonial, to illustrate the uncertainty of His Coming, and the consequences of heeding or not heeding the, cautions He already had given respecting it. It is the time after the wedding at the house of the bride’s parents (Horne’s Introd., vol. 2, p. 161, Barnes’s Com. loci, Lisco’s On the Parables, p. 183, Encyclop. Relig. Knowl., art. “Mar. Ceremony,” Smith’s Die. Bible, Meyer’s Com. etc.), and after the wedding festival there (which lasted several days—we are told seven for a maid and three for a widow), when the bridegroom, with the nuptial guests, conducts the bride to his own house or to that of his father, that is chosen. The procession generally started in the evening or night with great pomp, having torches, songs, and music. This company with the bridegroom, was met by another, friends of the bridegroom and bride, which, at or near the bridegroom’s house, waited, ready at the first notice of approach to go forth, meet the procession, unite with it, enter the house, and participate in the entertainment or marriage supper. This last company not knowing precisely the hour or time when the procession would come, made preparation and watched for its arrival, so that it could enter in with the bridal party—its union with the other and privilege of admittance, being indicated by the bearing of lamps, or burning torches, thus showing that they were friends, and as such could properly be admitted as guests at the marriage feast. After the procession entered the house with those who actually participated in the escort and manifested their friendship and respect for the bridegroom and bride, the door was shut and admittance refused.
>Obs. 5

### Storyline of this parable
#### Takes place after the wedding
#### Starts at the house of the bride's parents
#### After the wedding festival (7 days) at the bride's parents house
#### Groom and nuptial guests escort the bride and groom to the bridegroom's house (or his parents)
#### Escort starts at night with pomp, torches, songs, music
#### Escort meets another group (friends of the bride and groom) who have been waiting for the groom and bride, to enter the feast at the groom's house
#### Some who are waiting have run out of oil and must go buy some oil
#### After bride and groom arrive with their guests, the guests went in, the door was shut and no one else was admitted (the one's who had to go buy some oil did not make it in)

>these virgins join the procession on the return of the “bridegroom with the bride to their future abode (Obs. 5 and note). This accords with the previous withdrawal of the 144,000 (Prop. 130), with the Theocratic marriage at Mt. Sinai (Prop. 166), and with the procession of the bridegroom and bride to their future glorious abode on Mt. Zion. This agrees with the simple fact that these virgins, prepared to unite and enter into the marriage supper, are, not the bride, but guests who honor the bridegroom and the bride—virgins who follow the queen.
>Obs. 8

>the parable is expressly designed to illustrate what will occur, in relation to certain parties, at its realization.
>Obs. 9

>The foolish, therefore, are only excluded from these marriage festivities, but will ultimately be saved.
>Obs. 11

>Obs. 12. The “door being shut” and the declaration “I know you not,” are, therefore, simply expressive of exclusion to a position which the others, because of their preparation and readiness, obtain.

>Obs. 15. The parable enforces our position that there will be no conversion of the world prior to the Sec. Advent.

>Obs. 16. No matter whether this parable be interpreted as applying to the Church at the first stage of the Sec. Advent, or to the same at the last stage, or to the Jews at the open, manifested parousia as distinguished from the previous thief-like Coming, it corroborates and enforces our doctrine respecting the attitude of watchfulness and preparation for the Sec. Advent, the certainty and personality of that Coming, and the blessed results flowing to the righteous from that Advent.
