# Proposition 44. The preaching of the Kingdom, being in accordance with that of the predicted Kingdom, raised no controversy between the Jews and Jesus, or between the Jews and His disciples and apostles.

### Props Mentioned
69 70-76
### Jews found no fault in the kingdom, only the king
>The Jews did not find fault with the Kingdom, but in *the King* as believed in by believing Jews and Gentiles. In their blindness, they refused to acknowledge the purity and holiness essential to entrance into the Kingdom; they rejected the repentance requisite for its establishment; they were angered at the well-merited rebukes aimed at their hypocrisy and sinfulness; they were fearful of losing their own authority and power, and therefore *they rejected the King*, and urged his crucifixion. After His death, it was too humbling to their pride to confess *a crucified Jesus as their Messiah*; it was too mortifying and condemnatory to their past action to acknowledge *a once dead and buried Jesus to be their King*; the difficulty was *not* in the Kingdom, *but* in the King, and in the confession and obedience that was required. This influenced the nation, the great mass of the people, but nevertheless many Jews, seeing the Scriptures fulfilled in this Messiah, and the Messianic evidences in His birth, be, miracles, words, death, etc., still clung to Him as the promised Messiah, the Restorer of the Davidic Kingdom as predicted; and this was done under the assurance (as we shall show in its place) that He would come *the Second Time* for this very purpose. Such is the plain teaching of the Record, and its testimony on this point is *decided and overwhelming*, as the reader will see for himself as we proceed.
>p. 281 Vol. 1 Prop. 44 Obs. 4
### Less Jewish converts as kingdom view departed early church view
>It may be well to say here, that as long as this happy correspondence continued numerous Jews were converted to Christianity (as history attests), but *just so soon* as this disagreement arose respecting the Kingdom, and the Jewish faith in their Kingdom was derided and scorned, conversions became less and less until they almost ceased.
>NOTE: And as a return was made to the Primitive Church doctrine, conversions increased until they form now again a very fair number.
>p. 281 Vol. 1 Prop. 44 Obs. 5 and note 
### Linked to second advent to avoid jealousy of Roman power
>This agreement indicates, what has already been intimated, that no necessity existed to hold up the hope of a restored Davidic throne and Kingdom more prominently, because, as it all depended upon the coming again of Jesus the Christ, it was sufficient to direct attention to that Advent, linking the fulfilment of the prophecies with them, thus avoiding the jealousy, etc., of the Roman Power.
>p. 282 Vol. 1 Prop. 44 Obs. 6
### Kingdom view differed between first advent and second advent 
>. . . there was a strong point of contact and continued agreement between Judaism and Christians *in Messianic expectations respecting the Kingdom*â€”the difference being that the former located the fulfilment of their hopes *at the First Advent* of the Messiah (thus rejecting Jesus as the Messiah), and the latter, theirs *at the Second Advent* of this Jesus who had been crucified. To deny this, or to conceal it, is simply exhibiting gross ignorance of facts, or dishonesty in suppressing truth (comp. Prop. 69).
