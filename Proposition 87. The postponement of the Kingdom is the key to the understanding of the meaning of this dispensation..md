>So important is this fact that before entering into a direct description of the relation that the church sustains to this dispensation and to the Kingdom, we take the liberty of referring the reader to what has been proven concerning this postponement, Props. 56-68. If our position is correct (and we deem it, as the early church did, impregnable) then it follows, as a matter of course, that *many things* now applied by divines *to this* dispensation have *no relation whatever* to it.
>p. 590 Vol. 1 Prop. 87
### What dispensation intended?
>Obs. 1. It is a rule, more frequently violated than observed, that for a correct understanding of Scripture we should pay attention to *the particular* dispensation to which portions of it are intended to apply.
>...
>The “dispensation of grace to the Gentiles” (Eph. 3:2) is fully and completely identified with “the dispensation of the fulness of times” (Eph. 1:10), and the result is an interpretation which mingles and interweaves *that which God’s Purpose separates*. The definite postponement of the Kingdom, once entertained, preserves us from this free and plastic moulding of Scripture to suit our own ideas of the fitness of things.
>p. 590 Vol. 1 Prop. 87  Obs. 1
### The church is not the kingdom
>Obs. 2. Among the things which the postponement of the Kingdom effectually removes, is the prevailing opinion that *the Church is the promised Kingdom of the Messiah*.
