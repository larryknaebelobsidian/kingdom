# Proposition 86. The object or design of this dispensation is to gather out these elects to whom, as heirs with Abraham and his seed, Christ, this Kingdom is to be given.

>This Proposition is thus presented to recall, at this point of our discussion, some conclusions previously arrived at. We have shown 
>1. (1) Prop. 57, how the kingdom was rejected, 
>2. (2) Prop. 58, why it was postponed, 
>3. (3) Prop. 59, that during this postponement a seed is raised up unto Abraham, 
>4. (4) Prop. 63, that this seed, composing the elect nation, is the one to whom the Kingdom is given. 
>Therefore, whenever the design of this dispensation is distinctively referred to, it is to save them that believe, to proclaim the terms of salvation by which, if observed, men may become inheritors of Christ’s Kingdom, to gather out such a body of elect ones.

### Two mistakes not discussed in this proposition
>Obs. l. It is not necessary, under this heading, to notice two mistakes by which the affirmation of the Proposition is obscured by error, viz.: (1) the regarding this dispensation as the final one, and (2) the belief in the conversion of the world before the Sec. Advent. These will be made, hereafter, the subjects of special remark (as e.g. the first, under Props. 140, 138, 139, 137, etc., and the second, under Props. 175, 121, 122, 152, 153, etc.).
### Still future
>Obs. 2. If our argument has any logical force, based on the plain grammatical sense of covenant, and prophecy, and fact,—if it has any Scriptural weight in insisting upon a restored Theocratic order under David’s Son here on the earth where the previous Theocratic rule was inaugurated, —then the absence of such a Theocracy in the form covenanted, itself is sufficient to indicate that a dispensation or ordering under the personal reign of David’s Son is still future, and that the Millennial glory in the blessedness of nations will only then be realized.
### This recalls previous conclusions
>Obs. 3. Our Proposition is, consequently, only formulating, or recalling, the conclusions arrived at under previous ones pertaining to the election. It has been shown 
>1. (1) that there is an elect-people, Prop. 24, etc.; 
>2. (2) this elect-people for a certain and fixed time, is discarded, Prop. 59, etc.; 
>3. (3) another elect-people is gathered out, Prop. 61, etc.; 
>4. (4) the former election, now held in abeyance, is fully restored, re-engrafted in order to fulfil the covenant, Prop. 66, etc.; 
>5. (5) hence the design of this dispensation, or “times of the Gentiles,” in which this continuation of elected ones, grafted in, is going on, is not to establish the Kingdom but to prepare the way for the final restoration of that Kingdom to the covenanted people, Prop. 65, etc.; 
>6. (6) and that it is by our identification with that people that we also inherit with them, Prop. 64, etc. In the very nature of the case, this dispensation, as its progressive work indicates, can do no more than prepare the heirs for the Kingdom.
### This dispensation
>Obs. 4. Our argument regards this dispensation 
>1. (1) as preparative to the Kingdom; 
>2. (2) as introduced, because of the fall of the Jewish nation, raise up a seed unto Abraham; 
>3. (3) as elective and not national in the sew that it gathers out of all nations a people for God; 
>4. (4) as extending to all nations in its offers of mercy, but resulting in no conversion of nations an of individuals only; 
>5. (5) as spiritual in its designs and operations, so the no introduction of an outward exhibition of God’s Kingdom is to be expected in it; 
>6. (6) as one that will end in unbelief and Apostasy, just like previous dispensations, proving both the continued inherent depravity of man and the non-erection of the covenanted Kingdom; 
>7. (7) as one that is therefore, an extraordinary manifestation of Divine grace and forbearance in Him who knows the end from the beginning; 
>8. (8) as one connected wit! probation, trial, suffering, chastening, bereavement, etc., and to exalt which into the position of the Coming one (freed from these evils), is to do violence to the Word; 
>9. (9) as one which, in the establishment and perpetuation of the Christian Church, stands forth as a constant sign or witness the God’s purposes do not fail; 
>10. (10) and hence, as a standing proof that, how ever long delayed, the oath-bound Davidic covenant will be most amply realized.
### "Heirs with Abraham"
>Obs. 5. The covenanted relationship is recalled by the phrase, “heirs with Abraham.”
>...
>How comes it then that all the promises and threatenings revolve around that Jewish race as a central pivot, which is still recognized in the N. Test, as indispensable, since into that race we must be grafted, and to inherit we must be adopted as Abraham’s children? Why must we become Jews (i.e. of the seed of Abraham) in order to enter this Kingdom, if the promises are not given to that nation, and still pertain to them?
>...
>The “hope of Israel” is our hope;
### Noticing the design, defends
>Obs. 6. Noticing the design of this dispensation and not overloading it with things that belong to a coming one, Christianity itself, as it exists, is susceptible of a more easy defence against the attacks of infidelity.
