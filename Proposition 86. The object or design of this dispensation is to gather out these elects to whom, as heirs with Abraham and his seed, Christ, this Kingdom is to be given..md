>This Proposition is thus presented to recall, at this point of our discussion, some conclusions previously arrived at. We have shown 
>1. (1) Prop. 57, how the kingdom was rejected, 
>2. (2) Prop. 58, why it was postponed, 
>3. (3) Prop. 59, that during this postponement a seed is raised up unto Abraham, 
>4. (4) Prop. 63, that this seed, composing the elect nation, is the one to whom the Kingdom is given. 
>Therefore, whenever the design of this dispensation is distinctively referred to, it is to save them that believe, to proclaim the terms of salvation by which, if observed, men may become inheritors of Christ’s Kingdom, to gather out such a body of elect ones.

### Two mistakes not discussed in this proposition
>Obs. l. It is not necessary, under this heading, to notice two mistakes by which the affirmation of the Proposition is obscured by error, viz.: (1) the regarding this dispensation as the final one, and (2) the belief in the conversion of the world before the Sec. Advent. These will be made, hereafter, the subjects of special remark (as e.g. the first, under Props. 140, 138, 139, 137, etc., and the second, under Props. 175, 121, 122, 152, 153, etc.).

>Obs. 2. If our argument has any logical force, based on the plain grammatical sense of covenant, and prophecy, and fact,—if it has any Scriptural weight in insisting upon a restored Theocratic order under David’s Son here on the earth where the previous Theocratic rule was inaugurated, —then the absence of such a Theocracy in the form covenanted, itself is sufficient to indicate that a dispensation or ordering under the personal reign of David’s Son is still future, and that the Millennial glory in the blessedness of nations will only then be realized.

>Obs. 3. Our Proposition is, consequently, only formulating, or recalling, the conclusions arrived at under previous ones pertaining to the election. It has been shown 
>1. (1) that there is an elect-people, Prop. 24, etc.; 
>2. (2) this elect-people for a certain and fixed time, is discarded, Prop. 59, etc.; 
>3. (3) another elect-people is gathered out, Prop. 61, etc.; 
>4. (4) the former election, now held in abeyance, is fully restored, re-engrafted in order to fulfil the covenant, Prop. 66, etc.; 
>5. (5) hence the design of this dispensation, or “times of the Gentiles,” in which this continuation of elected ones, grafted in, is going on, is not to establish the Kingdom but to prepare the way for the final restoration of that Kingdom to the covenanted people, Prop. 65, etc.; 
>6. (6) and that it is by our identification with that people that we also inherit with them, Prop. 64, etc. In the very nature of the case, this dispensation, as its progressive work indicates, can do no more than prepare the heirs for the Kingdom.
