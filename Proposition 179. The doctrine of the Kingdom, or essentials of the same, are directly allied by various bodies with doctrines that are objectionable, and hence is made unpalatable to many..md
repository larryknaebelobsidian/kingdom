>It is a sad fact that many persons not being able to discriminate between truth and error, reject both because they happen to be thus connected in the faith of some denomination or sect.

### Christadelphians
>It is impossible in the history of the Church (with which Jesus promised to be continuously from His First Advent) to find any writer or any document which brings forth the Christadelphian faith as exhibited by Dr. Thomas and his followers.
>Obs. 1

>the impression is made, designedly or undesignedly, that Dr. Thomas by his superior enlightenment presented the doctrine after it had been totally ignored by all others.
>Obs. 1

### Seventh-Day Adventists

>they do not in any sense hold to a Millennium here on the earth during the thousand years.
>Obs. 2

>Ignoring the everlasting Davidic Covenant in its plain grammatical sense, and the prophecies in vindication of the same, they spiritualize the same, and hence have no correct conceptions conceptions of the Theocratic Kingdom. Their theory makes it a purely spiritual Kingdom—like that of Post-Millenarians. They have but little in common with Pre-Millenarians. The prophetism of Mrs. White is highly objectionable, because the falsity of her alleged ability to prophecy is made palpably evident by her interpretation and application of Scripture, thus showing that her predictions are only the result of her own imaginings, probably of a diseased mind strongly affected by religious ideas.
>Obs. 2

>They assert the following: that the Seventh Day alone was instituted as a Sabbath; that this was incorporated in the ten commandments; that these commandments were never abrogated, and hence are binding upon us; that Jesus only kept the Seventh Day, and we are exhorted to follow His example; that unless we keep the ten commandments as given we have have no right to enter the New Jerusalem; that the New Test, contains no passage affirming a change to be made from the seventh day to the first; and that the change from the seventh day to the first is due to the Papacy.
>Obs. 2

### Millerism
>Obs. 3. “Millerism” is most frequently associated with Pre-Millenarian-ism, when the simple truth is this: it has more points of association in belief with Post-Millenarianism than with Chiliasm.

>The only points of contact between Millerism and Pre-Millenarianism are the nearness of the Sec. Advent, and the duty of constant watchfulness.


### Second Adventism
>Obs. 4. “Second Adventism” is the outgrowth of “Millerism,” and is far more systematic in its statements, and contains more scriptural truth relating to Eschatology. But strictly they cannot be called Pre-Millenarian.

### Storrites/Destructionists
>a mingling of Materialism and Second Adventism, the complete and final destruction of the wicked being the leading characteristic of their faith.
>Obs. 5


### The No-Age People
>They are characterized by two peculiarities, viz., materialistic views, and a denial that the Sec. Advent is to be succeeded by an age to come.
>Obs. 5

### Anabaptists
>Obs. 6. Chiliasm is frequently allied with the following: “The Anabaptists” at the time of the Reformation. But a reference to their doctrines shows conclusively that they are far more in sympathy and unity with the Post-Millenarian view than with ours, because they believed, as the Whitbyans do, that they themselves, without the Second Advent and prior to the res. of the saints, could introduce the promised Mill, glory.

>they sought, by arms and force, to secure the supreme power and install themselves in the government of the earth, making the Church under themselves the covenanted and predicted Messianic Kingdom.
>Obs. 6
