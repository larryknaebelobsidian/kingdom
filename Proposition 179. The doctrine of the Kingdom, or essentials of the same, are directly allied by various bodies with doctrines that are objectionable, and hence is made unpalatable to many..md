>It is a sad fact that many persons not being able to discriminate between truth and error, reject both because they happen to be thus connected in the faith of some denomination or sect.

### Christadelphians
>It is impossible in the history of the Church (with which Jesus promised to be continuously from His First Advent) to find any writer or any document which brings forth the Christadelphian faith as exhibited by Dr. Thomas and his followers.
>Obs. 1

>the impression is made, designedly or undesignedly, that Dr. Thomas by his superior enlightenment presented the doctrine after it had been totally ignored by all others.
>Obs. 1

### Seventh-Day Adventists
>they do not in any sense hold to a Millennium here on the earth during the thousand years.
>Obs. 2

>Ignoring the everlasting Davidic Covenant in its plain grammatical sense, and the prophecies in vindication of the same, they spiritualize the same, and hence have no correct conceptions conceptions of the Theocratic Kingdom. Their theory makes it a purely spiritual Kingdom—like that of Post-Millenarians. They have but little in common with Pre-Millenarians. The prophetism of Mrs. White is highly objectionable, because the falsity of her alleged ability to prophecy is made palpably evident by her interpretation and application of Scripture, thus showing that her predictions are only the result of her own imaginings, probably of a diseased mind strongly affected by religious ideas.
>Obs. 2

>They assert the following: that the Seventh Day alone was instituted as a Sabbath; that this was incorporated in the ten commandments; that these commandments were never abrogated, and hence are binding upon us; that Jesus only kept the Seventh Day, and we are exhorted to follow His example; that unless we keep the ten commandments as given we have have no right to enter the New Jerusalem; that the New Test, contains no passage affirming a change to be made from the seventh day to the first; and that the change from the seventh day to the first is due to the Papacy.
>Obs. 2

### Millerism
>Obs. 3. “Millerism” is most frequently associated with Pre-Millenarian-ism, when the simple truth is this: it has more points of association in belief with Post-Millenarianism than with Chiliasm.

>The only points of contact between Millerism and Pre-Millenarianism are the nearness of the Sec. Advent, and the duty of constant watchfulness.


### Second Adventism
>Obs. 4. “Second Adventism” is the outgrowth of “Millerism,” and is far more systematic in its statements, and contains more scriptural truth relating to Eschatology. But strictly they cannot be called Pre-Millenarian.

### Storrites/Destructionists
>a mingling of Materialism and Second Adventism, the complete and final destruction of the wicked being the leading characteristic of their faith.
>Obs. 5


### The No-Age People
>They are characterized by two peculiarities, viz., materialistic views, and a denial that the Sec. Advent is to be succeeded by an age to come.
>Obs. 5

### Anabaptists
>Obs. 6. Chiliasm is frequently allied with the following: “The Anabaptists” at the time of the Reformation. But a reference to their doctrines shows conclusively that they are far more in sympathy and unity with the Post-Millenarian view than with ours, because they believed, as the Whitbyans do, that they themselves, without the Second Advent and prior to the res. of the saints, could introduce the promised Mill, glory.

>they sought, by arms and force, to secure the supreme power and install themselves in the government of the earth, making the Church under themselves the covenanted and predicted Messianic Kingdom.
>Obs. 6

### The Fifth-Monarchy Men
>that arose later in England”, entertained precisely similar views, believing that they themselves were called—without a prior Advent or res.—to set up the Fifth Universal Monarchy predicted by Dan. (comp. Hists. of England, Hume’s, Pictorial, Burnet, etc., etc., and arts. on, in Cyclops.). What Millenarians attribute to Christ’s Coming and His reign (and that of the saints), they, like Post-Millenarians—thought they could perform, or the Church through them. The only difference between Whitbyanism and these two classes mentioned —we admit a great one—is this, that the former seeks to gain its dream of conquest through moral and spiritual means, while the latter invoked violent measures to aid them. The dream, however, is common to both, making a Millennium without Christ a possibility.

### Catholic Apostolic Church (the offshoot of Irvingism)
>is Chiliastic, but in connection has an extreme hierarchical and liturgical formalism, having revived (as the Mormons) the Apostolate, and claims the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit perpetuated in their Church, thus having prophets, etc., in their midst.
>Obs. 7

### Plymouth Brethren/Believers/Darbyites
>being noted for their absolute Independentism. While strongly Chiliastic, they prominently set forth that all clericism and ecclesiastical forms are evil—Romish and Protestant Churches alike are Babel—that there is only one office, the spiritual priesthood of all believers, and every one has a right, as the spirit moves him, to preach, administer the sacraments, discipline, etc. They also claim the special gifts of the Spirit, and have a mystical tendency.
>Obs. 7

### Pre-Millenarianism, Post-Millenarianism, Anti-Millenarianism, Spiritualism
>numerous in the interpretation and application of Scripture. These are pointed out in detail as we proceed, arising from the principle of interpretation adopted, and relate to the manner of understanding the Abrahamic Covenant, the Davidic, the renewal of the covenant, the inheritance of the Christ, the Pre-Mill. Advent, the non-conversion of the world before the Advent, the first and second resurrections, the Judgeship of Jesus, the Judgment Day, the world to come, the Rest, the reign of Jesus and His saints, the restoration of the Jewish nation and their supremacy, the Antichrist and results, the Theocratic Kingdom, the Supernatural introduction of the Mill, age, the perpetuity of the earth and race, the design of this dispensation, the nearness of the Advent, the commanded posture and duty of believers, the prominency of “the blessed hope,” and various related subjects. Of course the correctness of belief must be decided by an appeal to Scripture, and the student must determine for himself which party obtains the strongest support from Holy Writ.
>Obs. 8

### Pre-millenarians
#### United
>In the grand outlines of Millenarianism, all Pre-Millenarians are united.

>Thus e.g. they all hold to a future Millennial age; this age to be preceded by the personal Advent of Jesus; this Millennial period to be bounded by a literal first and second resurrection, the former at the beginning and the latter at its ending. They all believe in a still future covenanted Messianic Kingdom introduced by the Sec. Advent, the resurrection and translation of the saints, and the restoration and repentance of the Jewish nation. They all teach the same design respecting this dispensation, the non-conversion of the world before the Sec. Advent, the same Judgeship of Jesus, the same Judgment Day, and related subjects.

#### Differences
>They differ as to the exact nature of the Kingdom, the manner and duration of the reign, the stages of the Sec. Advent, and in the interpretation and application of passages and predictions of Scripture; and this difference arises solely from the removal of the everlasting, oath-bound covenant of David out of their system (a fundamental neglect, inevitably leading to misapprehension) and from a spiritualizing interpretation incorporated, more or less, notwithstanding the plain grammatically expressed sense.

### Bitter history
>Obs. 10. We may add: when regarding the history of this doctrine, how it has been treated; how it has been perverted; how it has been held in bigotry; how believers in it are held apart by incorporated erroneous doctrines; how bitterness, malice, and prosecution have arisen concerning it; how on the one hand it is hated and abused, and on the other loved and cherished, we are sad at heart, and feel to say, “How long, O Lord.”
