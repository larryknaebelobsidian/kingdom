>That the Kingdom *was nigh* to the nation is distinctly stated, Matt. 4:17, Mark 1:14, 15, Luke 11:20, Matt. 12:28. The covenanted Theocratic Kingdom was overthrown; at the appearance of the promised Davidic son, who should inherit the Kingdom, it was *absolutely requisite*, in view of the *covenanted relationship* of the nation to this Kingdom, to offer it to the Jews for their acceptance. This *was done* by John, Jesus, and the disciples.

>the Kingdom was *offered as nigh, on the condition of repentance* annexed to the tender.

>It was left, we find, to the moral freedom of the representative men of the nation to receive or refuse it. The phrase “*nigh at hand*” is indicative of a tender, which, if necessary, can be withdrawn. The phrase is purposely chosen, pregnant with meaning, and, in view of the power of choosing, leaves a degree of indefiniteness about it, which is materially heightened by its dependence on the preceding “*repent*.” For *what then if they do not repent*? In that case will they notwithstanding *receive* the Kingdom, or will it *still* be nigh to them? Leaving following Propositions to answer these questions, let it now be suggested (what so many entirely overlook) that the exact reversal of this formula would be, If you do not repent, the Kingdom will be *far from you*; *now* it is nigh, within reach; *then* it will be distant, removed, postponed. Alas! how fearfully true this became: *nationally nigh, then nationally distant*.

>God never violates moral freedom in His purposes relating to the nation. Jesus, with full purpose of fulfilling, and yet foreknowing the sad result, employs the only language adapted to their free agency. Such expressions as "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life," "would not have this man to reign over us," "ye would not," "He came to His own, and His own received Him not," and kindred ones unmistakably indicate the power of choice.
