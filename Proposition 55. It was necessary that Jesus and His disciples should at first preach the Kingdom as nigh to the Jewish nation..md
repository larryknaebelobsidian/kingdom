>That the Kingdom *was nigh* to the nation is distinctly stated, Matt. 4:17, Mark 1:14, 15, Luke 11:20, Matt. 12:28. The covenanted Theocratic Kingdom was overthrown; at the appearance of the promised Davidic son, who should inherit the Kingdom, it was *absolutely requisite*, in view of the *covenanted relationship* of the nation to this Kingdom, to offer it to the Jews for their acceptance. This *was done* by John, Jesus, and the disciples.

>the Kingdom was *offered as nigh, on the condition of repentance* annexed to the tender.

>It was left, we find, to the moral freedom of the representative men of the nation to receive or refuse it. The phrase “*nigh at hand*” is indicative of a tender, which, if necessary, can be withdrawn. The phrase is purposely chosen, pregnant with meaning, and, in view of the power of choosing, leaves a degree of indefiniteness about it, which is materially heightened by its dependence on the preceding “*repent*.” For *what then if they do not repent*? In that case will they notwithstanding *receive* the Kingdom, or will it *still* be nigh to them? Leaving following Propositions to answer these questions, let it now be suggested (what so many entirely overlook) that the exact reversal of this formula would be, If you do not repent, the Kingdom will be *far from you*; *now* it is nigh, within reach; *then* it will be distant, removed, postponed. Alas! how fearfully true this became: *nationally nigh, then nationally distant*.

>God never violates moral freedom in His purposes relating to the nation. Jesus, with full purpose of fulfilling, and yet foreknowing the sad result, employs the only language adapted to their free agency. Such expressions as "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life," "would not have this man to reign over us," "ye would not," "He came to His own, and His own received Him not," and kindred ones unmistakably indicate the power of choice.

>The reader is reminded that this preaching of the nighness of kingdom, this offer of the Kingdom to the Jews at the First Advent on condition of repentance, is the *key* to the commingling of the Advents of Christ (Prop. 34). It could not be otherwise. It being predetermined as eminently suitable to tender this Kingdom at the First Advent of Jesus, the Messiah, and it being also foreknown that it would be rejected, the matter is so guardedly presented as not to interfere with the free moral agency of the nation, and as not to be opposed to foreknown fact. Yet both the rejection of the Kingdom at the First Advent, and the subsequent obtaining of it at the, now understood, *Second Advent* of Christ, *are unmistakably predicted*. Hence, too, in view of this offer and rejection, the prophets pass on and describe more repeatedly and vividly the scenes connected with the Second Advent.

>The reader, from what has been said, cannot fail to observe that this Kingdom, thus brought nigh by the offer made by Jesus and His coadjutors, is *the same* Kingdom predicted by the prophets (Prop. 35). There is only *one* Kingdom covenanted, the prophets describe but *one*, the Jews believed only in *one*, the disciples knew and preached only one, viz.: the covenanted Theocratic-Davidic. Jesus, coming to fulfil what the prophets predicted, the covenant demanded, could not preach any other Kingdom than the one described. Hence in His teaching He appeals to the prophets and appropriates their predictions to Himself (but only in so far as not to make the false impression that under Him the Kingdom was already established), as e.g. in Mark 12:10 He refers to the stone of Ps. 117, and applies it to Himself. This would naturally suggest the Stone of Dan. 2:34, 45, and the inference follows that, although rejected, He is the Head of the coming Kingdom, and through Him the God of heaven will yet set it up. So also Matt. 22:24, Luke 4:18,19, etc.; and He does this to make the rejection of Himself the more inexcusable in them.

>Writers in abundance censure Millenarians (as e.g. the Primitive Church) for believing in *the restoration* of the Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom under the Messiah, on the ground of its “earthly relations,” “carnality,” etc. They do not pause to reflect that, owing to its *Theocratic* nature, it *cannot be set up* without a suitable moral, spiritual preparation in the hearts of those who are to experience its blessings. The proof is found in this first preaching, in its being brought nigh on condition of repentance, in its being offered solely in view of a proposed change of character. Those who inherit it as kings and priests must be among the penitent (Prop. 91); the nation itself before it can enjoy its restoration must be converted (Prop. 113). Therefore, seeing *how* it was proposed at the First Advent to the nation, and *how* it is offered to us now conditionally on repentance and faith in Christ as a future inheritance, it becomes thoughtful, reverent men to be *extremely cautious how* they write concerning it.
