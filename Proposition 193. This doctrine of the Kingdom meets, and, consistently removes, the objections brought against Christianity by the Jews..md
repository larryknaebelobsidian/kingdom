>This is a wide field, and we can only briefly point out how, from our standpoint, a consistent answer can be given to the objections urged by Jewish unbelief against the reception of Jesus Christ.

>The history of the first and second centuries shows that it was nothing unusual for Jews to embrace Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah. But gradually such conversions became rarer, until they either entirely ceased or formed exceptionable eases. If we inquire into the causes of this change, it will be found that it resulted almost entirely in the departure of the large body of the Church from the Millenarian ground occupied by the early Church. The Origenistic, Augustinian, and succeeding theology discarded what was pronounced to be “the Jewish” element, and engrafted another, the Gentile, into its place.

>The Jew, however, cannot object to our system of interpretation, charging it with inconsistency, seeing that we apply the prophecies pertaining to their nation continuously; not only receiving the temporary rejection, the punishment inflicted, but also fully admitting the importance of the nation, its near (Theocratic) relation to God, and its ultimate restoration and triumph just as the grammatical sense predicts.

>Obs. 2. The doctrine of election, as held by us, removes Jewish prejudice. The Jew finds in the Old Test, a clear announcement of the elect condition of the Jewish nation, and its election practically confirmed by the Theocratic and Theocratic-Davidic arrangement. He reads, that, however much the nation may be punished for its sinfulness, and however individuals of the nation may forfeit blessings coming through this election, yet God will never utterly forsake it; but will, when the time has arrived, show His own faithfulness to Covenanted promises, His respect to His own election, and reinstate them in a position by which the election is fully vindicated. He even points to the oath of God as confirmatory of all this, and resting in the most solemnly pledged Word of God, rejects the anti-scriptural views largely incorporated with professing Christianity, and with them, wrongfully supposing them to be part of it, Christianity itself. The notion that the nation has forfeited its election, which is now simply conferred on individuals, chiefly Gentiles who remain such, is a stumbling-block in the way of the Jew. Our doctrine entirely meets his objections, seeing that we cordially acknowledge this Jewish election; that we insist upon it that notwithstanding their temporary cast-off condition, and their blindness, yet “as concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your sakes, but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes, Rom. 11:28; that we distinctly prove, that, owing to this very election, the Gentiles, in order to participate in the promises covenanted to the Jews, must be grafted in, adopted as part of the elect nation, virtually becoming the seed of Abraham and thus inherit the promises with Abraham; and that, when this incorporation of Gentiles (produced by Jewish defection) has been sufficiently carried out to raise up a seed unto Abraham (for Theocratic purposes) then will the elect Jewish nation be restored to its covenanted Theocratic-Davidic relation, thus vindicating and establishing its election before all nations. (Comp. e.g. Props. 24, 57, Gl, 63, in, 112, etc.
