# Proposition 193. This doctrine of the Kingdom meets, and, consistently removes, the objections brought against Christianity by the Jews.

### Props Mentioned
24 34 46-50 57 61 63 111 112 114 125 159 199 200

>This is a wide field, and we can only briefly point out how, from our standpoint, *a consistent answer* can be given to the objections urged by Jewish unbelief against the reception of Jesus Christ.
>p. 408 Vol. 3 Prop. 193
### Departure from chiliasm lead to fewer Jewish conversions
>The history of the first and second centuries shows that it was nothing *unusual* for Jews to embrace Jesus Christ as *the promised Messiah*. But gradually such conversions became rarer, until they either entirely ceased or formed exceptionable cases. If we inquire into the causes of this change, it will be found that it resulted almost entirely in *the departure* of the large body of the Church from the Millenarian ground occupied by the early Church. The Origenistic, Augustinian, and succeeding theology discarded what was pronounced to be “*the Jewish*” element, and engrafted another, the Gentile, into its place.
>p. 408 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 1
### Grammatical sense of interpretation
>The Jew, however, cannot object to our system of interpretation, charging it with *inconsistency*, seeing that we apply the prophecies pertaining to their nation *continuously*; not only receiving the temporary rejection, the punishment inflicted, but *also fully admitting* the importance of the nation, its near (Theocratic) relation to God, and its ultimate restoration and triumph *just as the grammatical sense predicts*.
>p. 410 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 2
### Understanding Jewish election removes Jewish prejudice
>Obs. 2. The doctrine of election, as held by us, removes Jewish prejudice. The Jew finds in the Old Test, a clear announcement of *the elect condition* of the Jewish nation, and its election *practically confirmed* by the Theocratic and Theocratic-Davidic arrangement. He reads, that, however much the nation may be punished for its sinfulness, and however individuals of the nation may forfeit blessings coming through this election, yet *God will never utterly forsake it*; but will, when the time has arrived, show *His own faithfulness* to Covenanted promises, *His respect* to His own election, and reinstate them in a position by which *the election is fully vindicated*. He even points to *the oath of God* as confirmatory of all this, and resting in *the most solemnly pledged Word of God*, rejects the anti-scriptural views largely incorporated with professing Christianity, and with them, wrongfully supposing them to be part of it, Christianity itself. The notion that the nation has forfeited its election, which is now simply conferred on individuals, chiefly Gentiles who remain such, is a stumbling-block in the way of the Jew. Our doctrine entirely meets his objections, seeing that *we cordially acknowledge this Jewish election*; that we insist upon it that notwithstanding their temporary cast-off condition, and their blindness, yet “as concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your sakes, *but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes*, Rom. 11:28; that we distinctly prove, that, owing to this very election, the Gentiles, in order to participate in the promises *covenanted to the Jews*, must be *grafted in, adopted as part of the elect nation*, virtually becoming the seed of Abraham and thus inherit the promises with Abraham; and that, when this incorporation of Gentiles (produced by Jewish defection) has been sufficiently carried out to raise up a seed unto Abraham (for Theocratic purposes) *then will the elect Jewish nation* be restored to its *covenanted* Theocratic-Davidic relation, *thus vindicating and establishing* its election before all nations. (Comp. e.g. Props. 24, 57, 6l, 63, in, 112, etc.
>p. 411 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 2
### Demonstrates necessity of the Messiah making a sacrifice of Himself for sin
>Obs. 6. It brings in with greater force and pertinency the necessity of the Messiah making *a sacrifice* of Himself for sin.
>p. 420 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 6

>... it specially directs attention to the necessity of His death in order that the Abrahamic Covenant itself may (as Paul argues) be sealed or confirmed.
>p. 420 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 6

>By *the efficacy* of this death, abundant provision is made for *the ample realization* of the covenant: an immortal King is provided who is able to save—through Him all that believe, can and will be saved as predicted, for He now has power to forgive sin, to save from the results of sin, to raise up the dead, etc.
>p. 420 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 6
### Prevailing theories of the kingdom are stumbling block to the Jew
>Obs. 7. The Kingdom as explained by the prevailing theories is a stumbling-block to the Jew.
>p. 422 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 7

>For, when he looks at the Church, or at this age, he finds *no such* a Messianic Kingdom as his prophets promised, *no such* a glorious restoration of his nation under Davidic rule as the Spirit predicted, and hence, influenced by the usurped claim of the Christian Church, and warped by the apparent antagonism, he turns away from Christianity itself.
>p. 422 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 7
### Christian apologists handle Jewish arguments poorly
>Obs. 8. How poorly in effectiveness the arguments of the Jew have been met by later Christian apologists, ...
>p. 423 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 8
### Gentiles are called upon not to be "high-minded"
>The spirit of it calls upon the Gentiles not to be “high-minded,” to consider that their call (as predicted even by Moses) is the result of Jewish unbelief, but which unbelief shall finally give place to a cordial reception of Jesus Christ, when the times of the Gentiles have run their allotted course.
>p. 424 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 9
### Vindicates Jesus and His teaching from Jewish ground
>It sympathizes most cordially with the down-trodden Jerusalem and the scattered nation, never forgetting that the glory of the adopted Gentiles and that of the Kingdom itself can *never* be realized, as promised, until Jerusalem and its nation experience the returned mercy of God and His Christ. It vindicates Jesus Christ and His teaching from the Jewish ground itself, and thus commends Jesus as the true fulfiller of the prophets.
>p. 424 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 9
### Messiah is a temporal deliverer
>Obs. 10. Our doctrine brings forth with prominency the idea that the Messiah is a temporal Deliverer.
>p. 425 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 10

>... it was assumed that the Messiah had *not yet* come, thus overlooking that the same prophets predict *a previous rejection* of the same Messiah, a consequent continued fall of the nation, a call of the Gentiles, and after a long endurance of punishment *the return* of the Messiah for promised deliverance.
>p. 425 Vol. 3 Prop. 193 Obs. 10
