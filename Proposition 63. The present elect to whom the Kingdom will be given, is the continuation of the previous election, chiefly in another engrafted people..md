# Proposition 63. The present elect to whom the Kingdom will be given, is the continuation of the previous election, chiefly in another engrafted people.

>This follows from what has preceded, and is thus thrown into a Proposition to impress it upon the mind. The previous, and the present, election *is founded on the promises and oath* to Abraham.
>p. 404 Vol. 1 Prop 63
### Similarities of the elect (Previous and Present)
>*Both* elect are the seed, the children of Abraham; *both* sets of branches are on *the same* stock, on *the same* root, on *the same* olive tree; both constitute *the same* Israel of God, the members of *the same* body, fellow-citizens of *the same* commonwealth; *both* are “*Jews inwardly*” (Rom. 2:29), and of the true “*circumcision*” (Phil. 3:3), forming *the same* “peculiar people,” “holy nation,” and “royal priesthood *both* are interested in the same promises, covenants, and kingdom; *both* inherit and realize *the same* blessings at *the same* time. From these and other considerations, involving *identity*, we find this election *a continuous one* by which the faithfulness of God shall be exhibited to the Patriarchs, to their obedient descendants, and to the engrafted believers taken from other nations.

### Manifestations of continuous election
>Obs. 2. This continuous election of the same body is manifested not only 
>1. in the predictions of the prophets, 
>2. in the reigning with the twelve tribes, 
>3. in participating with the Patriarchs in the blessings of the Kingdom, etc., but it is surprisingly represented even 
>4. in the description of the New Jerusalem, which has the names of “the twelve tribes of the children of Israel” (Rev. 21:12), showing that only those who are the children of Abraham have the privilege of constant association therewith.

### "Wall of partition"
>Obs. 3. This engrafting and continued election confirms what has already been said respecting “the wall of partition” being broken down, not between the Jewish nation and Gentile nations (Pressense, Early Days of Christianity, p. 292), but, between Jewish and Gentile believers in Christ (comp. Props. 24, 30, 49, 50, etc.).
### One grand continuous reality
>Obs. 4. In various works, the theory is advocated that the Christian Church is so entirely new in its institution, etc., that it is no continuation of the old order.
>...
>yet the expressive language by which it is carefully guarded, warns us to regard the past and the present church of God as *one grand, continuous reality* in the progress of the fulfilment of covenanted blessings.
>p. 406 Vol. 1 Prop 63 Obs 4
### No early church discrimination between ancient and modern elect
>The quite early church view, as seen in the writings of the Fathers, made no such *unjust* discrimination between the ancient and modern elect. Both were regarded in *the same light* and as belonging *to the same body*, and such persons as Barnabas, Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, and others pointedly traced the election of believers to their being *grafted into* the elect Jewish nation, i.e. that portion of the natural seed of Abraham which also believed and rendered obedience, and thus becoming, through adoption, members of the elect nation. We have already quoted language of theirs, illustrative of this feature, under previous Propositions. It may be added, that so identified, through faith in Jesus, did they feel themselves with the Patriarchs to whom the covenants were given, that (as e.g. Lactantius, Div. Insti., B. 4, ch. 10), they called them “our ancestors,” and vividly expressed the hope, in virtue of being adopted as their seed, of finally inheriting with them.
>p. 406 Vol. 1 Prop 63 Obs 5
### This is not a Gentile dispensation
>Obs. 6. While in relation to “the times of the Gentiles” and their calling, this might be named, as some do, a “Gentile dispensation,” yet it is a phrase not strictly correct,
### Apostles continued as faithful Jews
>This adoption and continued election, materially aids in throwing light upon the difficult question, why it was that the apostles and first Christians, with their faith and hope in Jesus Christ, continued faithful Jews, attending the religious religious services in the temple and synagogue; and that we have no distinctive utterance from the apostles, even when in council together considering the admission and circumcision of the Gentiles, respecting the abrogation of the Mosaic ceremonial law, etc., excepting by Paul afterward. The views entertained respecting virtual adoption, incorporation, and election caused them to occupy such a posture.
