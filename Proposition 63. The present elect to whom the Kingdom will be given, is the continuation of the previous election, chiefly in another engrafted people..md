>This follows from what has preceded, and is thus thrown into a Proposition to impress it upon the mind. The previous, and the present, election *is founded on the promises and oath* to Abraham.
>p. 404 Vol. 1 Prop 63

>*Both* elect are the seed, the children of Abraham; *both* sets of branches are on *the same* stock, on *the same* root, on *the same* olive tree; both constitute *the same* Israel of God, the members of *the same* body, fellow-citizens of *the same* commonwealth; *both* are “*Jews inwardly*” (Rom. 2:29), and of the true “*circumcision*” (Phil. 3:3), forming *the same* “peculiar people,” “holy nation,” and “royal priesthood *both* are interested in the same promises, covenants, and kingdom; *both* inherit and realize *the same* blessings at *the same* time. From these and other considerations, involving *identity*, we find this election *a continuous one* by which the faithfulness of God shall be exhibited to the Patriarchs, to their obedient descendants, and to the engrafted believers taken from other nations.
>p. 404 Vol. 1 Prop 63 Obs 1

>yet the expressive language by which it is carefully guarded, warns us to regard the past and the present church of God as *one grand, continuous reality* in the progress of the fulfilment of covenanted blessings.
>p. 406 Vol. 1 Prop 63 Obs 4

>The quite early church view, as seen in the writings of the Fathers, made no such *unjust* discrimination between the ancient and modern elect. Both were regarded in *the same light* and as belonging *to the same body*, and such persons as Barnabas, Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, and others pointedly traced the election of believers to their being *grafted into* the elect Jewish nation, i.e. that portion of the natural seed of Abraham which also believed and rendered obedience, and thus becoming, through adoption, members of the elect nation. We have already quoted language of theirs, illustrative of this feature, under previous Propositions. It may be added, that so identified, through faith in Jesus, did they feel themselves with the Patriarchs to whom the covenants were given, that (as e.g. Lactantius, Div. Insti., B. 4, ch. 10), they called them “our ancestors,” and vividly expressed the hope, in virtue of being adopted as their seed, of finally inheriting with them.

>This adoption and continued election, materially aids in throwing light upon the difficult question, why it was that the apostles and first Christians, with their faith and hope in Jesus Christ, continued faithful Jews, attending the religious religious services in the temple and synagogue; and that we have no distinctive utterance from the apostles, even when in council together considering the admission and circumcision of the Gentiles, respecting the abrogation of the Mosaic ceremonial law, etc., excepting by Paul afterward. The views entertained respecting virtual adoption, incorporation, and election caused them to occupy such a posture.
