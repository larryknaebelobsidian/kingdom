>The covenant forbids the idea to be entertained, for the Davidic covenant and the promises based on it, as we have shown, remain ‘unfulfilled, unrealized in the church. This Proposition is advanced in this form only to direct attention to the fact, that many writers affirm that the visible church itself is the kingdom. The arguments already advanced refute this notion, but leaving these to speak for themselves, we give some additional observations.

>The simple predicted facts, that the visible church is to *be overcome* by the Antichrist (comp. Props. 123, 162, 160, 161, etc.), and that the church *is saved by the personal Advent* of Jesus when under the most terrible of persecutions in the future—are sufficient in themselves to show that the nature of a Kingdom, as covenanted and predicted, does not appertain to the church. For, when the Kingdom is once established, all prophecy declares that, instead of being overwhelmed by its foes, it obtains dominion over the nations and ever afterward retains the same. No Antichrist can then give the option of worship or death.
