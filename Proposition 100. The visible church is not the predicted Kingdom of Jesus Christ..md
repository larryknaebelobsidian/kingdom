>The covenant forbids the idea to be entertained, for the Davidic covenant and the promises based on it, as we have shown, remain ‘unfulfilled, unrealized in the church. This Proposition is advanced in this form only to direct attention to the fact, that many writers affirm that the visible church itself is the kingdom. The arguments already advanced refute this notion, but leaving these to speak for themselves, we give some additional observations.

>Obs. 2. The reader will notice, that the visibility of the Kingdom in the church is a matter fully admitted by a host of our opponents.

>A Kingdom is often formed (as e.g. Olshausen, Com., vol. 2, p. 172) at the will of the writer to suit the occasion.
>Obs. 3

>Obs. 4. A number of authors, who declare that “the church on the earth, or the body of the faithful, is a true and visible representation of Christ’s Kingdom, the Kingdom of Grace, the mediatorial Kingdom,” also say, “the Patriarchal Church, the Jewish Church, and the Christian Church are but different names for the same church—they are all the Church of Christ.”

>Thus deep thinkers have of their own accord adopted the early church view, that the present state of the church is only provisional, but they certainly mistake when they (i.e. some of them) attribute the ultimate result, i.e. the development into a visible Kingdom such as prophecy demands, to the progress of the human race through religious, moral, mental, social, scientific, etc., influences, instead of, where prophecy places it, to the personal intervention and power of Christ.
>Obs. 5

>Obs. 6. The unsatisfactory correspondence of the present condition of (he church with the condition of the Kingdom of God as delineated by prophecy, has led sincere and ardent Christians, with most honorable motives, to agitate and press for constitutional amendments, by which states and nations, civil governments, are to become identified with the church as a sort of allies or guardians of Christianity. This is done under the supposition that in this way the Kingdom of Christ will be established and extended to meet the requirements of prophecy; and much laudation is expended in this direction.

>Let us be content with our “stranger and pilgrim” allotted condition until the time comes when God and His Son shall unite church and state, not under rulers liable to corruption, etc., but under tried and immortal ones.
>Obs. 6

>Obs. 7. Many of the last class also profess to guard their view against some objections by upholding the unchanged condition and supremacy of the church, making the state a very subordinate part in the future programme.

>Obs. 8. It is a truth, that a vast number of works are published in the interest of controversy and of doctrine respecting the church, in which the most important of all the questions concerning the church is either taken for granted or else entirely ignored. The leading, fundamental question, whether the church is truly the covenanted Kingdom of God, is, in many instances, entirely untouched.

>Obs. 9. Just in proportion as the notion that the visible church is the Kingdom of God is entertained and extended, in the same proportion will there also be an extravagant idea of superiority and supremacy over others.

>Obs. 10. This claim of making the visible church the Kingdom of God has been conducive to infidelity.

>Obs. 11. The simple predicted facts, that the visible church is to *be overcome* by the Antichrist (comp. Props. 123, 162, 160, 161, etc.), and that the church *is saved by the personal Advent* of Jesus when under the most terrible of persecutions in the future—are sufficient in themselves to show that the nature of a Kingdom, as covenanted and predicted, does not appertain to the church. For, when the Kingdom is once established, all prophecy declares that, instead of being overwhelmed by its foes, it obtains dominion over the nations and ever afterward retains the same. No Antichrist can then give the option of worship or death.
