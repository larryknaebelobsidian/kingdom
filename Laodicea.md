### The Judge
The Amen
the faithful and true witness
the Beginning of the creation of God

### The Consideration
Judge knows
- your deeds
	- neither hot nor cold (Judge wishes they were either)

### The Judgement
Because you are luke-warm (neither hot not cold), the judge will 
- spit you out of My mouth
Because you say you are rich, wealthy, in need of nothing (but you are really wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked)

### Corrective Action
I advise you to buy from Me 
- gold refined by fire so you may become rich
- white garments so you may clothe yourself and not have shame of your nakedness
- eye salve to anoint your eyes to see
Be zealous and repent - since I reprove and discipline those I love

### Reward
I anyone hears His voice and opens door - Judge will come in to him and will dine with him and he with me
To him who overcomes he will sit down with the Judge on His throne (as the judge did with His Father) 

He who has a ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches
