> The Scriptures cannot be rightly comprehended without a due knowledge of this kingdom. It is a fact, attested by a multitude of works, and constantly presented in all phases of Biblical literature, that the doctrine respecting the kingdom has materially affected the judgments of men concerning the canonical authority, the credibility, inspiration, and the meaning of the writings contained in the Bible. If in error here, it will *inevitably* manifest itself, e.g., in exegesis and criticism. This feature has been noticed by various writers, and, however explained, the views entertained on his subject are admitted to greatly modify the reception, the interpretation, and the doctrinal teaching of the Word.

### 16 Reasons
>Obs. 1. Its importance may be estimated by considering the following particulars: 
>1. The kingdom is the object designed by the oath-bound covenant (Prop. 49). 
>2. It is the great theme, the burden of prophecy (Props. 33-35, etc). 
>3. It is a subject which embraces a larger proportion of Revelation than all other subjects combined; thus indicating the estimation in which it is held by God. Dr. Pye Smith, Bickersteth, and others have well observed and commented on this peculiarity—viz., that inspired writers say more respecting the kingdom of Christ than they do concerning all other things treated or discussed in the Word. 
>4. It was the leading subject of the preaching of John the Baptist, Christ, the disciples and apostles (Props. 38-74). 
>5. It was a cherished subject of preaching in the primitive Church (Props. 75-77). 
>6. It is the foundation of a correct scriptural preaching, for the Gospel itself is “the gospel of the kingdom.” 
>7. To promote its establishment Jesus appears, suffers, and dies (Props. 50, 181), and to manifest it He will come again (Props. 66, 68, 130, etc.). 
>8. Jesus Christ Himself, must be deeply interested in it, since it is a distinguishing blessing and honor given to Him by the Father (Prop. 84), and belongs to Him as His inheritance (Props. 82, 116, etc.). 
>9. We are invited, as the most precious of privileges, to inherit this kingdom (Prop. 96). 
>10. It is the constantly presented object of faith and hope, which should influence us to prayer, duty, and watchfulness. 
>11. It is the result of the preparatory dispensations, enabling us to appreciate the means employed to attain this end. 
>12. It embraces within itself perfect completed redemption; for in it all the promises of God will be verified and realized. 
>13. It exhibits in an outward form the pleasure of the Divine will in the salvation of the race and the deliverance of creation (Props. 149, 145, etc.). 
>14. It brings the Divine utterances into unity of design (Props. 174, 175), exhibits manifested unity (Prop. 173), and vindicates the inspiration of Holy Writ (Prop. 182), including the Apocalypse (Prop. 176). 
>15. It enforces not only the humanity (Props. 82, 89) of Christ, but also His Divinity (Props. 85 and 183), with the strongest reasoning. 
>16. It exhibits to us the majesty and glory of Jesus, “The Christ,” as Theocratic King (Props. 88, 89, 132, 184, etc.), and the preeminent position of “the first-born” who are co-heirs with Him (Props. 118, 119, 127, etc.).

### Brought down from foremost to subordinate place
>Obs. 2. It is significant to the thoughtful student—a fulfilment of prophecy—that the idea of a distinctive Divine kingdom related to Christ and this earth, a kingdom which decidedly holds the foremost place in the teaching of Jesus, should be made, both (with few exceptions) in theology and the confessions of the Church, to come down from its first position in the Bible and occupy, when alluded to, *a very subordinate one*.

### Attractive to the reverent believer because he is an heir to it
>Obs. 6. This subject is attractive to the reverent believer not merely because of its being the absorbing theme of Old Testament prophecy and New Testament prediction, but owing to *the personal relationship* that he sustains, as an heir, to it. It is fitting to recognize, comprehend, and appreciate our inheritance. But even the literary aspect, the intellectual excellence of it, invites earnest investigation. Aside from its being a predominating idea of a book, which has had such a moulding influence in all the departments of life, it is the topic which, above all others, calls forth the most eloquent and sublime of all the descriptions and promises of the Bible, culminating in the last heart-stirring words of Jesus entrusted to John.
>p. 32 Vol. 1 Prop. 1 Obs. 6
### Worthy of earnest, devout and patient study
>Obs. 7. When surveying the vast array of facts and events, some the greatest that the world has ever witnessed, all pointing to this kingdom as a contemplated end; when looking at the same as they occur and exist to-day, preparatory to the kingdom; and when contemplating the host of remarkable, astounding events predicted to come to pass in connection with the kingdom still future, surely this forms a subject worthy, beyond all others, of the earnest, devout and patient study of every student of the world’s eventful and, without this key, perplexing history. The kingdom embraces so much, both in preparation and in actual realization, that, in view of its extent, the doctrine exceeds all others in magnitude, enfolding in itself nearly all doctrine.
