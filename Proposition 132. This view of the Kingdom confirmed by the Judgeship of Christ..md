>The Judgeship of Jesus establishes our doctrine of the Kingdom, the Pre-Mill. Advent, and His continued personal presence as the King. Intending to show that Judgeship and Kingship are in Scripture *equivalent* terms, it follows that if they are such, then, since the Kingship is specifically promised to Jesus Christ as the Son of Man, made thus necessary by the covenant, *so also the Judgeship ought to be expressed*. This is done. He is the Judge because He is “*the man ordained*,” Acts 17:31. Some theologians tell us that the reason why the Father thus constituted Jesus the Judge is (Knapp’s *Ch. Theol*., p. 542) “because He is man and knows from His own experience all the sufferings and infirmities to which our nature is exposed, and can therefore be compassionate and indulgent.” But the reader can see a far deeper reason, *grounded on the Covenant*. It is said, “*The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son; that all men should honor the Son even as they honor the Father*,” John 5:22, 23, and in verse 27 it is added: “*and hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man*.” Why the Son of Man? Because to this Son of Man as David’s Son *is promised* the Kingdom, and Judgeship being *included* in the promised Theocratic-Davidic government, the Father only judges through this Son. The promises based on the covenant *require* such authority to be given to and to be manifested through *the Covenanted Seed*. Hence, as the second Adam recovering the dominion lost by the first Adam; as the woman’s “seed who is to crush the serpent’s head; as the promised seed of Abraham who is to inherit the land, possess the gate of His enemies, and make all nations blessed; as the Son of David who is to reign so gloriously over the earth; as the God-man who perfects salvation through a Theocratic ordering—it is *indispensably necessary* for Him to occupy such a position to meet the predetermined plan of Redemption.

### Misapprehended by monkery and schoolmen
>... no single doctrine is perhaps so greatly misapprehended as this one; for which we are indebted to the originators of monkery and to the schoolmen.
>p. 352 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 1
### A matter of congratulation and rejoicing
>... the Prophets describe this Judgeship—the exercise of it—as a matter of *congratulation and rejoicing*, and not, as it would be if it *only denoted* judicial investigation of character, a subject of dread or apprehension. Thus e.g. Ps. 67:4, “*O let the nations be glad, and sing for joy; for Thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth*.” Comp. Ps. 96:10-13; Ps. 98:5-9, etc. It is represented as a *joyful event* by the Spirit; one which will cause exultation and happiness, and this only becomes apparent if we understand it to embrace the reign, Kingdom of Jesus.
>p. 353 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 2
### Joyful event, causing exultation and happiness
>It is represented as *a joyful event* by the Spirit; one which will cause exultation and happiness, and this only becomes apparent if we understand it to embrace the reign, Kingdom of Jesus.
>p. 353 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 2
### Judicial, legislative, executive, supreme power, kingly
>Jesus Christ is the Judge, Acts 17:31; Matt. 24:30; Rom. 14:9, 10; John 5:22; Acts 10:40; Matt. 25:31, etc. The question that we are to propose and answer is this: Are we to understand by this Judgeship that Christ *only* sits in a judicial capacity to determine cases; that as Judge He *only* presides in a tribunal of justice to decide respecting the innocence or guilt of men; or, is far more embraced in this term, *such as judicial, legislative, and executive action, a supreme power, Kingly rule*?
>p. 353 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 3

>The word Judge is not to be taken here in its usual signification, i.e. one who determines controversies and denounces the judgment of the law in criminal cases, but one who *directs and rules* a state or nation with *Sovereign power*, administers justice, makes peace or war, and leads the armies of the people over whom he presides.
>p. 354 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 3

>Horne (Introd., vol. 2, p. 42) says: “The authority of the judges was *not inferior* to that which was afterward exercised by *the Kings*; it extended to peace and war. They decided causes without appeal, but they had no power to enact new laws or to impose new burdens upon the people. They were protectors of the laws, defenders of religion, and avengers of crimes.”
>p. 354 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 3

>Judgeship was therefore regarded as the equivalent of rulership, of kingly rule; and how largely this idea is incorporated with Scripture will appear in the quotations that follow.
>p. 354 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 3

>From the use of the word already stated, it is a just conclusion, drawn by the early Church and many eminent writers, that when Jesus is represented to be *revealed as the Judge*, we are not to understand that He *only* presides as a Jurist to pronounce innocent or guilty, as the case may be, but that He rules in *a princely manner*, exercises *a kingly office*, is revealed as *King of kings, Sovereign* of the world, and that His Judgeship, *being Theocratic*, consists in exercising *all the powers of a Supreme Governor*, legislative and executive as well as judicial, so that the acts of His Judgeship shall be manifested in *issuing* His decrees, *executing* His laws, *punishing* offenders, *rewarding* the faithful, and *carrying on* the Divine Theocratic ordering of His Kingdom. In other words, the Judgeship is identical *with the predicted reign of Christ*, commencing with the Millennial era—an age inaugurated and carried on by the most astonishing manifestations of *Sovereign power*, judicial, legislative, and executive.
>p. 354 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 3

>The student can readily find an abundance of such allusions, a rich golden vein in the prophetic mine.
>p. 356 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 4

>Obs. 5. The modern usage of the words “Judge” and “Judgment” have *misled* many in comprehending this subject, so that some assert, as Priest, that they cannot see how the Millennial period and judgment *can be blended*.
>p. 357 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 5

>... the meaning to be attached to the word in any particular case must be determined by the context, general analogy—in brief, by the laws controlling language, giving the preference in all cases *to scriptural usage*.
>p. 357 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 5

>Because “judge” is employed to designate judicial action, that is no reason for discarding *the additional meanings* attached to it by the Word of God.
>p. 357 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 5

>... whether, when Christ *is revealed as Judge*, this Judgeship is not *an equivalent* to His Kingly rule. This we think is already conclusively proven, ...
>p. 358 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 5

>The Judgeship of Christ is not only perfectly consistent with the glory and blessedness of the Millennial period, but *indispensably necessary* to secure it.
>p. 358 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 5

>Obs. 6. The concessions made by writers when not directly opposing us are decidedly in our favor.
>p. 359 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 6

>Obs. 7. This judging is connected with the casting out of Satan.
>p. 359 Vol. 2 Prop. 132 Obs. 6
