# Proposition 127. In support of our view, the Apocalypse unmistakably teaches a Pre-Millennial resurrection of the saints.
### Props Mentioned

### Rev. 11:18
p. 264 Vol 2 Prop. 127 Obs. 1
And the nations were enraged, and Your rage came, and the time _came_ for the dead to be judged, and to give reward to Your slaves—the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the great—and to destroy those who destroy the earth.

### Rev. 20:1-6
p. 264-266 Vol 2 Prop. 127 Obs. 2
Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. 2 And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; 3 and he threw him into the abyss, and shut _it_ and sealed _it_ over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were finished. After these things he must be released for a short time. 4 Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I _saw_ the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their witness of Jesus and because of the word of God, and who also had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand. And they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. 5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. 6 Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.

### Souls
>The *very persons* (not others) killed by the beast are the ones who live and reign during the thousand years.
>p. 268 Vol. 2 Prop. 127 Obs. 3

>Hence the peculiarity of the language here, “*first resurrection*” is, that *these also, the ones* subject to this great tribulation during the period of Rev. 14:9-13, shall come forth also *having the privileges of the first-born*, i.e. they are not of the second or future ones, but belong to the first as well as those who may have preceded them. (The reader will clearly see the force of this when we come to the reign of saints, etc.) The word “first” is, as Parkhurst (Lex.) and others assert, employed to denote “*dignity of persons*” in the sense of “*chief*” “*principal*,” etc., as in Matt. 20:27; Acts 13:50; 1 Tim. 1:15; Acts 17:4; 25:2; 28:7, 17, etc. This resurrection is, therefore, the *chief principal, pre-eminent one, because it pertains to that of the first-born*, constitutes the persons embraced in and experiencing its power *the first-born* that belong exclusively—*in a peculiar sense* typified by the Jewish first-born—*to God Himself*. Hence not time but distinction is denoted.

>... notice, the wicked cast into the fire *preceding* the Millennial age; ...

### Dead saints (but not dead unsaved) are raised for the Millennium and unsaved dead after the Millennium
p. 273-278 Vol. 2 Prop. 127 Obs. 4

>This inheriting of the earth Christ promises to all the meek (Matt. 5:5), but to do this they must, of necessity, arise from the dead, and when they inherit the wicked are “cut off,” “perish,” “are not,” etc., thus *corresponding* with the period under consideration.
>p. 274 Vol. 2 Prop. 127 Obs. 4

>6. A most circumstantial statement indicating the Pre-Millennial resurrection and that the rest of the dead do not participate in it, is found in Isa. chs. 24, 25, and 26.

>For then we have -- not the saints of past ages, but -- the martyrs and those associated with them *under the last great tribulation* of the culminated Antichrist. All that we contend for is, that the persons designated are persons who at a time still future experience this persecution and martyrdom, and that the rest of the saints are included in the "thrones", "judgement", and general affirmation respecting the first resurrection and the reign.

>Of what practical use or benefit can such a res. unto condemnation and shame be? the answers are various; such as, 
>1. to vindicate the justice of God; 
>2. to prove the truthfulness and reality of His representations and mercy; 
>3. to apportion “the few or many stripes” that the guilty merit; 
>4. to fulfil His declaration that all the wicked snail see and acknowledge the Divine power; 
>5. to show that death itself, as many fondly hope, is no refuge for the sinner; 
>6. that a res. unto eternal life is the special gift of God through Jesus Christ; 
>7. to contrast the condition of the res. saints with their own; 
>8. to root out in the most effectual manner every remnant of evil; 
>9. to give to the creatures of God, the universe itself, a sublime and abiding idea of the nature and consequences of sin.
