### Rev. 11:18 - Obs. 1

### Rev. 20:1-6 - Obs. 2

### Souls - Obs. 3
>The very persons (not others) killed by the beast are the ones who live and reign during the thousand years.
>p. 268 Vol. 2 Prop. 127 Obs. 3

>Hence the peculiarity of the language here, “*first resurrection*” is, that *these also, the ones* subject to this great tribulation during the period of Rev. 14:9-13, shall come forth also *having the privileges of the first-born*, i.e. they are not of the second or future ones, but belong to the first as well as those who may have preceded them. (The reader will clearly see the force of this when we come to the reign of saints, etc.) The word “first” is, as Parkhurst (Lex.) and others assert, employed to denote “*dignity of persons*” in the sense of “*chief*” “*principal*,” etc., as in Matt. 20:27; Acts 13:50; 1 Tim. 1:15; Acts 17:4; 25:2; 28:7, 17, etc. This resurrection is, therefore, the *chief principal, pre-eminent one, because it pertains to that of the first-born*, constitutes the persons embraced in and experiencing its power *the first-born* that belong exclusively—*in a peculiar sense* typified by the Jewish first-born—*to God Himself*. Hence not time but distinction is denoted.
