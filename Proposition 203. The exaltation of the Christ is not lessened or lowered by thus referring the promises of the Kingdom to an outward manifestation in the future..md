# Proposition 203. The exaltation of the Christ is not lessened or lowered by thus referring the promises of the Kingdom to an outward manifestation in the future.
### Error of exalting the Divine, leaving out the human nature of Christ
>Obs. 1. The objection intimated in the Proposition against our doctrine, proceeds from a one-sided view of the Person of Christ, exalting the divine as if exclusive, and leaving out the human as if it were no longer a factor in Redemption.
>...
>Such practically ignore David’s Son, and thus degrade Him. (1) By denying His present continued Davidic relationship; (2) and by refusing to believe that the covenant promises can only be realized through David’s Son.
### Descended from David, His proper covenanted humanity
>Obs. 2. In exalting Jesus as “the Son of Man,” in His descent from David, in His proper covenanted humanity, we, as a corresponding result, honor the divine which is inseparably united with it.
>...
>Certainly we cannot degrade the Saviour when we make His humanity (as well as the divine), as the Bible does, a continued and most important factor in the progressive work of Redemption, actively and visibly engaged in its accomplishment (comp. Props. 81-85 and 196-202).
### Incarnation exalted
>Obs. 3. Regarding the Incarnation as part of the continuous unfolding of the Divine Purpose, especially in reference to this very Kingdom, we certainly exalt it, when showing how necessary and indispensable it continues to be in order to carry out that Purpose as contained in the covenants and revealed by the prophets.
### Constant source of praise, honor, glory to Christ and the Father
>Obs. 4. This reign of the Son of Man, including the fulfilment of God’s pledged Word and the Salvation of a world, is invariably represented in Scripture as not only a constant source of gladness and exultation in those who participate in its blessings, but of praise, honor, and glory to Christ and the Father. Read the Millennial descriptions of this covenant Kingdom, and they are full of passages expressive of the great glory awaiting the Son of David when He enters upon His Theocratic reign.
### Perfected humanity realized
>Obs. 5. This reign of David’s Son and Lord, presents to us here on earth a realization of that yearning after a perfected humanity which has characterized man’s history.
### "The Man ordained"
>Obs. 6. In the Judgeship of Christ, in His august Kingship, we make “the Man ordained” just as the Bible does, the central figure, the culminating point in the salvation realized in this Kingdom, without discarding or lessening the divine united with Him.
