## Props Mentioned
[[Proposition 120. This Kingdom with its Millennial blessings can only be introduced through the power of God in Christ Jesus.|120]] 
### 55 proofs of the personal pre-millennial advent of Christ
Observation 8 (pp. 174 - 192) discusses 55 proofs. This is an extremely valuable section. Worthy of much study.

### A personal coming of Christ is required to accomplish these items

>Again, we ask the reader to consider the peculiar and distinctive work that is to be accomplished in the Mill, age, and are we not abundantly justified in insisting upon a personal Coming which *alone* (Prop. 120) can adequately account for its performance? 
>The resurrection from among the dead, 
>the renovation of nature, 
>the restoration of all things, 
>the re-establishment of the Davidic throne and Kingdom, 
>the complete subversion of anti-christian domination, 
>the exaltation to power and authority of the pious, 
>the entire reversal of the moral, social, and political condition of the world, 
>the binding of Satan, 
>the utter destruction of the enemies of God, 
>the perfect vindication of truth and justice, etc.—
>all this, embracing the most radical and grand changes that the world has yet witnessed, demands the personal intervention of Him in whom all power is lodged. Therefore the general analogy of Scripture, as our line of argument clearly evinces, insists upon, and takes even for granted, this personal Pre-Mill Advent.

### Pre-Mil condemns man, therefore man hates it

>Considering the prominence and preciousness of this doctrine of a Pre-Mill. Advent, it is strange that men should so persistently reject and condemn it, notwithstanding the cautions and warnings given. The reason for its unpopularity and bitter opposition must be found in its *condemnatory* nature. It sets aside all human systems, all worldly schemes of regeneration, all man-devised plans to realize the Messiah’s Kingdom on earth, all confidence in the resources of nature, reason, etc., declaring that the personal intervention of Jesus, the Christ, is requisite to bring about the world’s restoration to Millennial blessedness. This is *humbling* to man’s pride, to his worldliness, to his schemes of reformation, all of which this Advent dooms to destruction. This exalting of the Christ and His work is *condemnatory* of man and his work, and hence man hates it, for it is a constant and jarring *protest* to his vain ideas of progress and reform, to his estimate of the Church’s and world’s actual mission and condition.
>p.196 Vol. 2 Prop. 121 Obs. 12 

### The greatest and grandest event the world has ever witnessed

>This Sec. Advent will be *the greatest and grandest* event that the. world has ever yet witnessed. Great and glorious as was the First Advent—unspeakably precious and indispensably necessary unto Salvation —yet it was a Coming in humiliation and ending in death, with a glimpse at exaltation, but this is a Coming in overwhelming power, splendor, majesty, and glory—a Coming in triumph and like *the mighty Theocratic King*. To this Coming the Scriptures *especially* turns the eye of faith and speaks of it in the most lofty and exultant strain; and we may rest assured that what God *thus* describes, and to which He directs *the hope* of prophets, Apostles, and believers, must be *inconceivably* magnificent. It is *an honor* to aid in upholding and directing attention to it.
>p.197 Vol. 2 Prop. 121 Obs. 13

### Maranatha

>The early Christians, as numerous writers assert, had as their watchword the expressive “*Maranatha*” or “*The Lord Cometh*.” This word “Maranatha” was used by the Jews (comp. Macknight, *Ency. Relig. Knowl*., etc.) expressive for “our Lord comes” (Lange, 1 Cor. *loci*), and is appropriately applied by Paul (1 Cor. 16:22) to the Sec. Advent of Jesus, thus according with the “Coming One” of Matt 11:3; Luke 17:19, 20; John 6:14, and 11:27; Jude 14, and in Revelation. The usage (see Props. 74 and 75) and belief based thereupon forbid the notion of an intervening Millennium. Considering the Scriptural testimony for our faith already given (and much to be presented in following Propositions), and the exceeding preciousness of this Coming, well may we conclude this Prop, by urging the reader to have impressed upon mind and heart the pregnant word ‘Maranatha” (comp. Brookes’s *Maranatha*, pp. 7-11).
