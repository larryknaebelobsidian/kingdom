### Divine political dominion
>Obs. 1. The Kingdom embraces not merely visibility but a divine-political dominion (Prop. 117) superseding all other Kingdoms, as e.g., Dan. 2:44; Rev. 11:15; Dan. 7:13, 14, 18-27; Zech. 14:9, etc.

>Obs. 2. The concession, that such a Kingdom is still in the future, is all that at present our argument needs.

>Obs. 5. If the popular definition of the Kingdom of God, viz., that it is “God’s reign in the heart” (thus confounding God’s Sovereignty with a special Kingdom of promise) is correct, how comes it that the prophets assign it specified time and place in the future? How comes it that it is spoken of as established at a certain period, and as pertaining to the humanity of Jesus Christ?

>Ohs. 6. The Herald of the Morning (June 15, 1878, August 1, 1877, etc.) makes the future Kingdom “spiritual,” and denounces us in our belief as “materialists.”
