# Proposition 116. This Kingdom, is a visible, external one, here on the earth, taking the place of earthly kingdoms (comp. Props. 122, in, 123, etc.).

### Props Mentioned
117 159 197
### Divine political dominion
>Obs. 1. The Kingdom embraces not *merely visibility but a divine-political dominion* (Prop. 117) superseding all other Kingdoms, as e.g., Dan. 2:44; Rev. 11:15; Dan. 7:13, 14, 18-27; Zech. 14:9, etc.
>p. 117 Vol 2 Prop. 115 Obs. 1
### Still in the future
>Obs. 2. The concession, that such a Kingdom is still in the future, is all that at present our argument needs.
>p. 117 Vol 2 Prop. 115 Obs. 2
### Not "God's reign in the heart"
>Obs. 5. If the popular definition of the Kingdom of God, viz., that it is “God’s reign in the heart” (thus confounding God’s Sovereignty with a special Kingdom of promise) is correct, *how* comes it that the prophets assign it specified time and place in the future? *How* comes it that it is spoken of as established at a certain period, and as pertaining to the humanity of Jesus Christ?
>p. 119 Vol 2 Prop. 115 Obs. 5
### Example of opposer
>Ohs. 6. The *Herald of the Morning* (June 15, 1878, August 1, 1877, etc.) makes the future Kingdom “spiritual,” and denounces us in our belief as “materialists.”
>p. 120 Vol 2 Prop. 115 Obs. 6
