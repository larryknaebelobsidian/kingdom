>It is important to consider this Scripture referred to, since it is supposed by many to form an objection to our doctrine of the Kingdom; whereas correctly apprehended according to the analogy of Holy Writ, it forms an additional proof in behalf of our position.

>Obs. 1. Probably no passage of Revelation has received in modern times such extravagant interpretation as John 14:1-3.

>The early Church well posted in the meaning of the “Father’s house,” and assigning to it only its scriptural definition, had no difficulty with it (seeing that none is intimated).

>Those early believers more logically consistent than many eminent moderns, rested satisfied with the description of the house as given in the Old Test., and hence were protected against those interpretations afterward fastened upon the passage.

>We are mainly indebted again to Origen for a departure from the primitive faith.

>... do not stop to examine the passage as it stands related to both covenant and prophecy.

>...the cause of all such departures lies in the misconception of the Kingdom that is covenanted to Jesus Christ, and in which the saints are to have their inheritance.

>Obs. 2. Let us endeavor to ascertain the scriptural meaning of “Father’s house.”

>it is the house of the Kingdom

>It must not be separated from the Kingdom; it being the head of the Kingdom and designed for its establishment and perpetuation. So closely are the two united, that the Kingdom itself — flowing out of this “house” —is called “the house” that was found and left desolate by Jesus (Matt. 23:38 etc.) “the tabernacle of David fallen” and in ruins, or the royal house of David (called “house” and “mine house” i.e. adopted as God’s in 2 Sam. 7:1 seq. and 1 Chron. 17:11-27) in an abject condition.

>The word “house” linked with God, naturally suggests a particular relationship; that He in some manner is identified with it; and this is fully sustained in the position that Jerusalem will occupy (as e.g. Zech. 8:3) in the restored Theocratic arrangement.
