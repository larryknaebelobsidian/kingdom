>It is important to consider this Scripture referred to, since it is supposed by many to form an objection to our doctrine of the Kingdom; whereas correctly apprehended according to the analogy of Holy Writ, it forms an additional proof in behalf of our position.

### Extravagant interpretations
>Obs. 1. Probably no passage of Revelation has received in modern times such extravagant interpretation as John 14:1-3.

>The early Church well posted in the meaning of the “Father’s house,” and assigning to it only its scriptural definition, had no difficulty with it (seeing that none is intimated).

>Those early believers more logically consistent than many eminent moderns, rested satisfied with the description of the house as given in the Old Test., and hence were protected against those interpretations afterward fastened upon the passage.

>We are mainly indebted again to Origen for a departure from the primitive faith.

>... do not stop to examine the passage as it stands related to both covenant and prophecy.

>...the cause of all such departures lies in the misconception of the Kingdom that is covenanted to Jesus Christ, and in which the saints are to have their inheritance.

>the cause of all such departures lies in the misconception of the Kingdom that is covenanted to Jesus Christ, and in which the saints are to have their inheritance.

### Meaning of "Father's house"
>Obs. 2. Let us endeavor to ascertain the scriptural meaning of “Father’s house.”

>it is the house of the Kingdom

>It must not be separated from the Kingdom; it being the head of the Kingdom and designed for its establishment and perpetuation. So closely are the two united, that the Kingdom itself — flowing out of this “house” —is called “the house” that was found and left desolate by Jesus (Matt. 23:38 etc.) “the tabernacle of David fallen” and in ruins, or the royal house of David (called “house” and “mine house” i.e. adopted as God’s in 2 Sam. 7:1 seq. and 1 Chron. 17:11-27) in an abject condition.

>The word “house” linked with God, naturally suggests a particular relationship; that He in some manner is identified with it; and this is fully sustained in the position that Jerusalem will occupy (as e.g. Zech. 8:3) in the restored Theocratic arrangement.

>“the Father’s house” and “the Lord’s house” established at the Second Coming by the Mighty King, are one and the same.

>An overwhelming stream of prophecy indicates the identity; and Jesus sustains it in the most delicate manner by calling it, in view of the relation that He sustains in the Theocratic order, “the Father’s house,” which the prophets, in their relationship, did not directly employ, but substituted “The house of the Lord,” “The city of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel,” etc.

### Many mansions
Obs. 3
>Commentators inform us that the word translated “mansions” may denote either the act of dwelling, or the place where one dwells, or a station or position occupied therein. It is of little consequence which idea is intended, for either one of them imply that in this house the saints will dwell possessing stations of honor and glory.

>these disciples are encouraged with the hope of being specially near to Him in the very place of royal manifestation, which is explained in other passages as sitting upon thrones and judging the twelve tribes of Israel, agreeably to the Theocratic ordering.

### If it were no so, I would have told you
Obs. 4
>“If it were not so," i.e. if you believed wrong—if your faith and hope were erroneous, etc.

>“I would have told you.” By this expression He affirms that He would not, as a faithful Teacher, leave them, if misapprehending the truth, under a mistake.

### I go to prepare a place for you
Obs. 5
>Jesus is not only the Divine Architect of the New Jerusalem, but in the full and complete preparation of the place for the Redeemed is included the creation of the New Heaven and New Earth, the restoration of the Theocratic Kingdom, the making of all things new.

>The phraseology appears to intimate that the preparation is not immediately complete, but continuous, extending even to His Coming again.

### Receive you unto myself
Obs. 6
>Some commentators tell us that by this Coming again, etc., is meant His Coming by death to remove saints to this “house.”

>When Jesus comes again, He remains upon this earth; the Bible closes with leaving Him, the saints, and the New Jerusalem here, and it is an unwarranted adding to the Word, a violation of an oath-bound covenant, a removal of Him from His inheritance, throne of glory, and Theocratic Kingdom, to say that He is taken away, or goes away again from this “New Heaven and New Earth.” Jesus comes again to restore the Theocratic Kingdom, and as the saints are associated with Him in rulership, they then receive the portions assigned them in this “Father’s house.”’ Hence, 2 Thess. 2:1, 2, etc., “the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering unto Him,” are united.

>This Coming is itself dependent upon the completion of certain preparatory measures, such as: 
>1. until the last one of the chosen, elect, determined number of saints is gathered out of this dispensation who are to be kings and priests in the Coming one; 
>2. until the decreed consumption of the land and people has culminated to its closing; 
>3. until the ordained times of Gentile domination are about accomplished. 
>Then when all things are ready, “The Christ” comes, sent by the Father, One with the Father, to accomplish and perfect the Father’s will, and in the place, selected in preference to all others, where the Theocratic Presence alone is vouchsafed, there will he receive His believing brethren that they may ever be with Him.
>-- Obs. 6 reformatted

>In the intermediate state the saints are waiting for the period of manifestation, when the reward, the crown, the inheritance, etc., is bestowed by the Theocratic King and they forever enter the enjoyment of their several “mansions” in “the everlasting Kingdom,” of which the glorious “Father’s House” forms the crowning head, adorned and ennobled by the descended New Jerusalem with which it is evermore One. Thus the Scriptures harmonize, making (instead of several and many localities and worlds, etc.) covenant promises, predictions, and doctrines consistent one with the other, referring to one period, one place, one great Kingdom, one magnificent royal city (the Old and the New in union) and one mighty King of kings swaying lordly dominion, as David’s Son and Theocratic Ruler, over all the earth restored to the favor and blessing of the Father.
