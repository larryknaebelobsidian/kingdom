### Props Mentioned
43 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 121 152 168 169

>It is important to consider this Scripture referred to, since it is supposed by many to form an objection to our doctrine of the Kingdom; whereas correctly apprehended according to the analogy of Holy Writ, it forms an additional proof in behalf of our position.
>p. 53 Vol. 3 Prop. 170
### Extravagant interpretations
>Obs. 1. Probably no passage of Revelation has received in modern times *such extravagant* interpretation as John 14:1-3.
>p. 53 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 1

>The early Church well posted in the meaning of the “Father’s house,” and assigning to it only its scriptural definition, had no difficulty with it (seeing that none is intimated).
>p. 53 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 1

>Those early believers more logically consistent than many eminent moderns, rested satisfied with the description of the house as given in the Old Test., and hence were protected against those interpretations afterward fastened upon the passage.
>p. 53 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 1

>We are mainly indebted again to Origen for a departure from the primitive faith.
>p. 53 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 1

>... do not stop to examine the passage as it stands *related to both covenant and prophecy*.
>p. 54 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 1

>...the cause of all such departures lies in *the misconception of the Kingdom that is covenanted to Jesus Christ*, and in which the saints are to have their inheritance.
>p. 54 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 1
### Meaning of "Father's house"
>Obs. 2. Let us endeavor to ascertain the scriptural meaning of “*Father’s house*.”
>p. 54 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 2

>...it is the house of the Kingdom ...
>p. 55 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 2

>It must not be separated from the Kingdom; it being the head of the Kingdom and designed for its establishment and perpetuation. So closely are the two united, that the Kingdom itself — flowing out of this “house” —is called “*the house*” that was found and left desolate by Jesus (Matt. 23:38 etc.) “*the tabernacle* of David fallen” and in ruins, or *the royal house* of David (called “*house*” and “*mine house*” i.e. adopted as God’s in 2 Sam. 7:1 seq. and 1 Chron. 17:11-27) in an abject condition.
>p. 55 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 2

>The word “*house*” linked with God, naturally suggests *a particular relationship*; that He in some manner is identified with it; and this is fully sustained in the position that Jerusalem will occupy (as e.g. Zech. 8:3) in the restored Theocratic arrangement.
>p. 55 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 2

>... “*the Father’s house*” and “*the Lord’s house*” established at the Second Coming by the Mighty King, *are one and the same*.
>p. 56 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 2

>An overwhelming stream of prophecy indicates *the identity*; and Jesus sustains it in *the most delicate manner* by calling it, in view of the relation that He sustains in the Theocratic order, “*the Father’s house*,” which the prophets, in their relationship, did not directly employ, but substituted “*The house of the Lord*,” “*The city of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel*,” etc.
>p. 56 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 2
### Many mansions
Obs. 3
>In this "house" are "*many mansions*." Commentators inform us that the word translated “mansions” may denote either the act of dwelling, or the place where one dwells, or a station or position occupied therein. It is of little consequence which idea is intended, for either one of them imply that in this house the saints will dwell possessing stations of honor and glory.
>p. 57 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 3

>... these disciples are encouraged with the hope of being *specially near* to Him *in the very place* of royal manifestation, which is explained in other passages as sitting upon thrones and judging the twelve tribes of Israel, agreeably to the Theocratic ordering.
>p. 57 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 3
### If it were no so, I would have told you
Obs. 4
>... “*If it were not so*," i.e. if you believed wrong—if your faith and hope were erroneous, etc.
>p. 58 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 4

>... “*I would have told you*.” By this expression He affirms that He would not, as a faithful Teacher, leave them, if misapprehending the truth, under a mistake.
>p. 58 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 4
### I go to prepare a place for you
Obs. 5
>Jesus is not only the Divine Architect of the New Jerusalem, but in the full and complete preparation of the place for the Redeemed is *included* the creation of the New Heaven and New Earth, the restoration of the Theocratic Kingdom, the making of all things new.
>p. 59 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 5

>He is even engaged in preparing, i.e. qualifying, testing, etc., the believers for the places intended for them in the Father's house. The phraseology appears to intimate that the preparation is not immediately complete, but continuous, extending even to His Coming again.
>p. 59 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 5
### Receive you unto myself
Obs. 6
>Some commentators tell us that by this Coming again, etc., is meant His Coming *by death* to remove saints to this “house.” But this is opposed not only by the spirit of the passage and by parallel passages but even many of our opponents *themselves refuse* to accept it owing to its harshness.
>p. 59 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 6

>When Jesus comes again, He *remains upon* this earth; the Bible closes *with leaving* Him, the saints, and the New Jerusalem here, and it is *an unwarranted adding* to the Word, *a violation* of an oath-bound covenant, a removal of Him *from* His inheritance, throne of glory, and Theocratic Kingdom, to say that He is taken away, or goes away again from this “New Heaven and New Earth.” Jesus comes again to restore the Theocratic Kingdom, and as the saints are associated with Him in rulership, they then receive the portions assigned them in this “Father’s house.”’ Hence, 2 Thess. 2:1, 2, etc., “*the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering unto Him,*” are united.
>p. 59-60 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 6

>This Coming is itself dependent upon the completion of certain preparatory measures, such as: 
>1. *until* the last one of the chosen, elect, determined number of saints is gathered out of this dispensation who are to be kings and priests in the Coming one; 
>2. *until* the decreed consumption of the land and people has culminated to its closing; 
>3. *until* the ordained times of Gentile domination are about accomplished. 
>Then when all things are ready, “The Christ” comes, sent by the Father, One with the Father, to accomplish and perfect the Father’s will, and in the place, selected in preference to all others, where *the Theocratic Presence* alone is vouchsafed, there will he receive His believing brethren that they may ever be with Him.
>p. 60 Vol. 3 Prop. 170 Obs. 6 reformatted

>In the intermediate state the saints are waiting for the period of manifestation, when the reward, the crown, the inheritance, etc., is bestowed by the Theocratic King and they forever enter the enjoyment of their several “mansions” in “the everlasting Kingdom,” of which the glorious “Father’s House” forms the crowning head, adorned and ennobled by the descended New Jerusalem with which it is evermore One. Thus the Scriptures harmonize, making (instead of several and many localities and worlds, etc.) covenant promises, predictions, and doctrines *consistent one with the other*, referring to *one* period, *one* place, *one* great Kingdom, *one* magnificent royal city (the Old and the New in union) and *one* mighty King of kings swaying lordly dominion, as David’s Son and Theocratic Ruler, over all the earth restored to the favor and blessing of the Father.
