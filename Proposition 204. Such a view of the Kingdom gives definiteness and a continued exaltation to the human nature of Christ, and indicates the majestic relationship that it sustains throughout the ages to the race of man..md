# Proposition 204. Such a view of the Kingdom gives definiteness and a continued exaltation to the human nature of Christ, and indicates the majestic relationship that it sustains throughout the ages to the race of man.

>Obs. 1. If the Incarnation was the medium through which (John 14:9) the Father is manifested to men, will it not continue to be so at Christ’s “appearing and Kingdom if it was the most stupendous fact in the history of the world,

>Obs. 2. This is in direct contrast with the prevalent theory, which makes the human nature very prominent in the life and death of Jesus, less so after His ascension, and still less after the judgment day.

>We advocate not merely the eternal glorification of the human nature, but its future revelation and the presentation to it (Props. 81-84) of the actual visible Sovereignty of the world, from which it is never displaced, as will be seen when we speak of the perpetuity (Prop. 159) of the Kingdom.
>Obs. 3

>Obs. 4. Considering the highly important part that this human nature of Jesus has yet to perform in the scheme of Redemption and in the history of the world, it is a sad defect in those learned and valuable works relating to the life and Person of “the Christ” (as e.g. Neander’s, Ullman’s, Lange’s, Dorner’s, etc.), that they confine themselves almost exclusively to the First Advent, to the intermediate period in heaven, and to the present dispensation in order to assign the reasons why that humanity was taken, and to describe the results that shall How from it.
>Obs. 4

>Obs. 5. Some systems of theology, rightfully apprehending the importance of the Incarnation in the Plan of Redemption, and impressed by the great stress laid upon it in Holy Writ, endeavor to rescue it from the neglected or one-sided position into which it had fallen, but are themselves led, by ignoring its covenanted relationship to the Kingdom, into another extreme, viz., that the Incarnation in some mystical but real manner is transfused into every believer.

>The simple fact is, that the philosophical truth lying at the basis of the Incarnation is found not merely in the provision made for our salvation in the birth, life, death, resurrection, and ascension of this Jesus, but in the bestowal of the covenanted requirements in order that He might be properly constituted Theocratic King, and in what that humanity has yet to perform, in fulfilment of covenanted promises, in the ages to come. To view only what has been done and what is now progressing, is to see one side of the truth; but to look in addition at what shall be done in the future, and to combine these, is to grasp the whole truth.
>Obs. 7

>Obs. 8. The quite early Church (during the Chiliastie period) preserved a strictly logical and consistent attitude respecting the humanity of Christ.

>the perfect union of the Divine with man without the Divine absorbing or lessening the same, so that the Son of Man, i.e. David’s Son, forever remains such, and the Son of God, i.e. the Divine, forever continues such, both combined constituting the Theocratic Christ.
>Obs. 11

>this Anointed One,” this present exalted Theocratic Ruler, died for us. Redemption through His blood so exalts and fixes the affections of His associated kings and subjects upon Him that the prediction, in the love and praise of mankind, is realized of their being “a willing people.”
>Obs. 12

>Obs. 15. Therefore, to preserve the due relationship that the human nature of Jesus sustains even in its exaltation and glorification to the Kingdom and to the race, we must never swerve from the covenants.
>. . .
>In this discussion the covenant is the measure of accuracy, being the most solemnly given and strongly affirmed portion of God’s Holy Word. We need not repeat that the grammatical sense is alone allowable (comp. Prop. 49).

>Jesus, consequently, is constantly spoken of as the Son of God, and His reign is based exclusively on His Divinity. Entire systems of Divinity, given by learned men, make no mention whatever of the Davidic covenant, and, as a consequence, exclude the humanity of Jesus from any participation in this reign with the prominency given to it in Scripture; the humanity, somehow, simply by virtue of its having been related to the divine, becomes some vague, indefinite appendage, without bearing its noble covenanted distinctive relationship in manifested Rulership. Now this is the Origenistic, Augustinian, Popish derived view, unfortunately held and endorsed by many Protestants.
>Obs. 16

>Obs. 17. It is sad to reflect that so many of God’s ancient elect people, the Jews, should so far depart from the covenants expressly given to them— should so far reject faith in the Son of David, who is ultimately to reign according to the oath of the Almighty, that they put their trust in man himself. Alas! what a difference exists between the covenanted “Sure mercies of David” as presented in the Word, and that belief e.g. of Mr. Ellinger (editor of the Jewish Times), who said (quoted Luth. Observer, Oct. 31st, 1873) at the meeting of Free Religionists, held at New York in opposition to that of the Evang-Alliance of 1873, “that humanity was the Messiah of the Jews.”
