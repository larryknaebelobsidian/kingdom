# Proposition 173. This Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ may be near at hand.

### Props Mentioned
59-65 111 112 113 130 143 161
### Precise time not given
>Obs. 1. The *precise time* for the Kingdom to be established is not given.
>p. 92 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 1
### Postponement is indefinite as to time
>Obs. 2. The postponement of the Kingdom is *indefinite* as to time, for where it is specifically stated it is always in connection with phraseology (such as “the times of the Gentiles,” or until he comes again, etc.) which gives no regular chronological date or succession.
>p. 95 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 2
### Dependent on a certain number of elect ones gathered out
>Obs. 3. This Kingdom as we have seen in previous Propositions (as e.g. Props. 64-65) is dependent upon *a certain number of elect ones* that must previously be gathered out.
>p. 95 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 3
### Depends on coming of the King, near, any time
>Obs. 4. This Kingdom is dependent upon the Coming of the King, but the Advent of this King, in its several aspects, is *nowhere positively conjoined to the ending of any chronological period*, and, in view of this fact, *may be near—indeed may occur at any time*.
>p. 96 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 4

>It is true, and this is the reason why the mistake is made by numerous writers, that one stage or act of the Sec. Advent is directly joined to the close of some of those periods (being allied with the destruction of Antichrist and the deliverance of the Jewish nation, etc.), viz. *His visible open Coming* with His saints. But this is very different from His *previous* coming *for* those saints, who participate with Him in the destruction of Antichrist, and thus leads us to allow *an interval* (short or long, as the case may be) *before* such a Coming in “vengeance.”
>p. 96 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 4

>This teaches (see Props. 130, etc.) us not *to limit* the Sec. Advent by dates; it is not bound by them only as the last grand act of Coming for the overthrow of the Confederation is concerned; for, as previously intimated, Scripture surely points out that even *before* this last Confederation is formed (so e.g. Rev. 14, etc. Comp, preceding Props.), and the great tribulation is entered, that saints are removed in a manner which can only be attributed to the Sec. Advent, being specifically joined to it by the Spirit as a result. This conclusively instructs us that this Advent—concealed to the world and known only by experience to the favored ones—*precedes for a time*—not given by such dates—the visible world manifestation and destruction of Antichrist.
>p. 96-97 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 4

>... if the exact time of this first secret Coming were given, it would invalidate the express declarations that *no one* shall be cognizant of it.
>p. 97 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 4

>Hence it is, that this Coming—this Advent embracing from its first stage to the last a distinctive interval of time—is represented as one that may happen *at any time*; one that we are to watch *for constantly*; one that we are to look for without placing *anything intervening* (to be yet fulfilled) between it and the present, seeing that the stage or manifestation (to saints) at its beginning is never included in dates, but always enshrouded in mystery; always represented as coming *unknown* to all men and to the angels. From this it follows, not knowing the length of this interval, and not having definite events (for those are embraced in this interval) to guide us into a recognition of the time when the Advent really begins, that such a Coming and its resultant (the Kingdom) *may be near*, so near that we dare not positively assert that it shall be delayed a single day, week, year, etc.
>p. 97 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 4

### Intentional obscurity to encourage watchfulness
>We believe that this very diversity—this inability by a unanimity to fix *the exact* closing of the sixth Milliad—the introduction of those chasms, and the obscurity of certain dates, is *intentional* in order to place us in the commanded position of *watching*.
>p. 98 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 5

>Now let the reader consider, that it was upon this ending of the sixth Milliad that the Church has *so often* through its greatest representative men *fixed her eye as the important crisis* of the world’s history; ...
>p. 98 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 5

>... let him even consider that from the analogy of the past it is *most reasonable* to anticipate some great movements and changes in the dispensational orderings—and from such reflections he must conclude not only that we live in a period when great changes are to be expected, but in one *not very distant* from the introduction of the predicted Kingdom of God.
>p. 98 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 5

>... all writers whether Pre- or Post-Millenarians, who undertake to give us chronological calculations (we say nothing respecting their correctness) regarding the incoming Millennial age *unite* in asserting that that age *is nigh at hand*.
>p. 98 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 5
### Should always be regarded as near
>Obs. 6. It is important to notice that this indefiniteness as to the exact time is to the thoughtful not only evidence of the inspiration of the Word, but a reason *why* the end should always be regarded as near.
>p. 100 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 6

>Let the student compare the chronological dates, and see how they are presented, *purposely* in a form so obscure or hidden, that the wisest of scholars admit a degree of uncertainty appertaining to a decided apprehension of the same; and yet so framed in with the text of prediction given by various prophets that they harmonize with it and each other, and he must conclude that men, separated from each other by ages, etc., could not unaided have given to us such *a wonderful combination, so indefinite* as to *exact* time, and yet *so definite* as in the general course *to point each age* to a future that was imminent.
>p. 100 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 6

>Suppose that a precise unmistakable date were given; *then* many commands (as e.g. Matt. 24:43-51 and 25:13; Mark 13:3337, etc.) could not be observed; *then* those exhortations to be in constant readiness for it (as e.g. Luke 12:35, 36, 40, and 21:34, etc.) would lose their force; because it would be impossible to watch, etc., as the Spirit enjoins (for our personal good) until the time stated definitely had come.
>p. 100 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 6

>When the apostolic Fathers wrote (as e.g. Clement) Let us *every hour* expect the Kingdom of God When the Reformers (as e.g. Luther) long after said: “Though the signs may seem uncertain, yet no man can despise them *without* danger; seeing there can be not only *no* danger, but also *great profit*, if, reckoning them as true, thou shalt *prepare* thyself to meet thy Saviour; that is, if, bidding farewell to present things, thou shalt be wholly taken up with the desire of the Kingdom of God that is Coming when eminent men in Europe, America, etc., at this day proclaim that “*the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh*;" all these only occupy the position and maintain the attitude *assigned to believers*.
>p. 101 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 6
### Must accept the exact phraseology of the Bible
>Obs. 8. That interpretation of the Scriptures is the only correct one, which can truly and freely accept of *all* the divine utterances without the least attempt to soften them, or to explain them away, or to receive them with a sort of mental reservation. The test in this case is the incorporation of and using without contradiction, *the identical phraseology* of the Bible.
>p. 105 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 8

>An Eschatology which leaves out the biblical exhortations respecting the *nearness* of the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, and our duty to watch for it, really takes *the life out of the subject*, and gives us but a cold dead body for faith and hope to grasp. Those who do this, strive to make amends by so exalting the intermediate state and the condition of the saints, that if we were to credit them, the Advent itself is of *comparatively little consequence* so far as the increased happiness and honor of the saints is concerned.
>p. 105 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 8

>Clement (First Epis., ch. 35): “Let us therefore earnestly strive to be found in the number of those *that wait for Him*, in order that we may share in the promised gifts,” or, (Sec. Epis. ch. 12) “Let us expect, therefore, *hour by hour the Kingdom of God* in love and righteousness, since *we know not* the day of the appearing of God.”
>p. 105 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 8

>The adoption of Scripture phraseology with hearts of faith, the cordial reception and belief in the language given by inspired men, leads us to the *same* logical position occupied by the primitive Church.
>p. 105 Vol. 3 Prop. 173 Obs. 8
### Be prepared every hour
>Luther (Walch’s *Luth.*, 13 vols. Cols. 34-43 on Luke 21:25-30) “the Lord admonishes us Christians not to place the date of our lives here upon the earth, but to know that our Lord and Redeemer shall come from heaven, and thus be prepared *every hour to expect His Coming*; likewise, that we should be but half, and with the left hand, in this world, while with the right hand, and with the whole heart, we are *in waiting* for that day when our Lord shall come in His glorious majesty and power, which no man can describe.” “Let us have respect to the words of Christ and *expect* His Coming,” etc. (Comp. Barnes’s *Notes on Rev.* 10:6.)
