# Proposition 31. This Theocracy or Kingdom was identified with the Davidic Kingdom.

>The Theocracy and Davidic kingdom, in virtue of a *special and peculiar covenant relationship* between the two, were regarded *as one*, and in the future *so identical* in destiny that they are *inseparably linked together*.
>p. 234 Vol. 1 Prop. 31
### Evidence of connection
>Obs. 1. This is also evidenced by three things—
>1. (1) The Davidic throne and Kingdom is called the Lord s. Thus, e.g. in 1 Chron. 28:5, it is “the throne of the Kingdom of the Lord over Israel”; in 2 Chron. 13:8, “the Kingdom of the Lord ”; and in 2 Chron. 9:8, the King is placed by God “on His throne to be King for the Lord thy God.” 
>2. (2) The King was expressly designated “the Lord’s Anointed” (1 Sam. 24:6, 2 Sam. 19:21, etc.). 
>3. (3) The Prophets, after the establishment of the Davidic throne and kingdom, invariably identify the glorious Kingdom of God, the blessed Theocratic rule, as manifested through the same, as e.g. Jer., chs. 33 and 36, Amos 9, etc. The reason for this lies in the firm and perpetual union.

### King under God's special care
>Obs. 2. The King was under God’s special care, and treason against the King was treason against God; it was only when engaged in sin that God’s care was removed and the people were exhorted to resist wickedness even in the chief.
>p. 235 Vol. 1 Prop. 31 Obs. 2
### Theocratic union demonstrated
>Obs. 3. This Theocratic union is shown also in the fact that not only all the Theocratic laws and arrangements, previously made, *remained* in full force, and the King obligated himself to see them enforced, but in important matters pertaining to the nation the King was to consult with, and obey the imparted instructions of, the Chief Ruler. The numbering of the people (2 Sam. 24 and 1 Chron. 21) by David *without* divine permission, being an infringement of Theocratic order, an act of insubordination to his Superior, was correspondingly severely punished.
>p. 235 Vol. 1 Prop. 31 Obs. 3
### New Testament connects Theocratic and Davidic Kingdoms
>Obs. 4. The identity of the Theocratic Kingdom with the Davidic is taken for granted in the New Test, as an indisputable fact. This will appear, as our argument progresses; for some preliminaries must first be considered in their historical connection. The announcing angel states the fact (Luke 1:32, 33), and Zacharias intimates it (y. 68-74).
