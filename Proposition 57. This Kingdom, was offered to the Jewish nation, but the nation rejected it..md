>That it was offered in good faith we have seen—the mission of John, Jesus, and the disciples *being confined* to the nation. But the nation, instead of repenting and receiving the Messiah, conspired through *its representative men*, the chief priests, scribes, and elders, to put Him to death. The entire record of the Gospels shows how He was persecuted and finally crucified, as John 1:11, Luke 19:14, Matt. 10:21, Matt. 20:18, 19, etc. By this action they said: “*We will not have this man to reign over us*;” by this conduct they evinced how *utterly unprepared*, morally, they were for a *restored Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom, under the Messiah*.

>If it be asked, Why this imposed condition of repentance? the answer is plain. Such a Theocratic Kingdom under the Messiah, with the accompanying elevation of the Jewish nation -- *as covenanted and predicted* -- cannot possibly be established without a suitable moral preparation.
