# Proposition 57. This Kingdom, was offered to the Jewish nation, but the nation rejected it.

### Props Mentioned
26 34 55 

>That it was offered in good faith we have seen—the mission of John, Jesus, and the disciples *being confined* to the nation. But the nation, instead of repenting and receiving the Messiah, conspired through *its representative men*, the chief priests, scribes, and elders, to put Him to death. The entire record of the Gospels shows how He was persecuted and finally crucified, as John 1:11, Luke 19:14, Matt. 10:21, Matt. 20:18, 19, etc. By this action they said: “*We will not have this man to reign over us*;” by this conduct they evinced how *utterly unprepared*, morally, they were for a *restored Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom, under the Messiah*.
>p. 375 Vol. 1 Prop 57

>If it be asked, Why this imposed condition of repentance? the answer is plain. Such a Theocratic Kingdom under the Messiah, with the accompanying elevation of the Jewish nation -- *as covenanted and predicted* -- cannot possibly be established without a suitable moral preparation.
>p. 375 Vol. 1 Prop 57 note
### Modern reformed Jews deny sin resulted in the fall of the nation
>The modern Reformed Jews deny that the fall of the Jewish nation resulted from sinfulness.
>p. 376 Vol. 1 Prop 57 Obs. 1 note
### Fear of Roman power
>The leading reason assigned by the priests and Pharisees in council (John 11:47, 48) for putting Jesus to death (whom they hated for exposing their rottenness, and insisting upon repentance) was, that by acknowledging Him as their King, they should bring the Roman power upon themselves, which would destroy “both our place and nation.” Here certainly *was lack of faith in a Theocratic King and Kingdom*. And on this very charge was He arraigned before Pilate (Luke 23:2, 3); thus hatred causing them to choose *Caesar, instead of “Christ, a King*.” Let the reader reflect: their guilt was aggravated by a knowledge of the covenanted Kingdom, of a covenanted Messiah in David’s line able to protect against all earthly power, and hence their malignity was manifested in causing the death of One who gave all the predicted evidences of Messiahship, and *in taking advantage* of the very tender of this Kingdom to them in procuring His condemnation. Their knowledge of the covenants and prophets, their acquaintance with the works of Christ, made the rejection *the more deliberate and cruel*. Knowing the claims of the predicted Messiah, knowing that if He ever came He should be truly a King on David’s restored throne—this makes the charge produced by them and their conduct in the matter *the more dastardly and inexcusable*. What was offered in mercy and love, they make *the basis* of accusation and death.
>p. 376 Vol. 1 Prop 57 Obs 2
### Offer made in good faith
>This Kingdom was offered to the nation in good faith, i.e. it would have been bestowed *provided* the nation had repented. The foreknown result made no difference in the tender of it, so far as the free agency of the nation is concerned; that result flowed from a *voluntary choice*.
>p. 377 Vol. 1 Prop 57 Obs 4

>It follows, then, that the Jews had *the privilege* accorded to them of accepting the Kingdom, and if the condition annexed to it had been complied with, *then* the Kingdom of David would have been most gloriously re-established under the Messiah.
>p. 377-378 Vol. 1 Prop 57 Obs 4
