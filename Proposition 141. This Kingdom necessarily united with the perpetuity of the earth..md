# Proposition 141. This Kingdom necessarily united with the perpetuity of the earth.

### Props Mentioned
105 137 138 139 140 142 144 145 146 148 150 151 152 154

>Necessarily, because this earth is the *promised inheritance* tendered to Abraham; this earth is the theatre *on which* David’s throne and Kingdom existed, and if re-established at the Sec. Advent demands its continuance; this earth is *covenanted* to David’s Son and promised to the saints, and hence God’s *oath and faithfulness* are involved in its perpetuity (comp. Props. 137, 138, 139, 140, 142, 144, 152, etc.).
>p. 427 Vol. 2 Prop. 141
### Not a Lutheran doctrine
>Obs. 1. The misleading phrase “the end of the world” has been considered under the previous Prop.
>p. 427 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 1

>Dr. Hodge (*Sys. Div.* vol. 3, p. 853) declares, on the authority of Schmid (*Dog.*), that the Lutheran doctrine is that the world shall be reduced to nothing. This indeed may be the individual opinion *of some* Lutheran divines, just as it is that *of some* Calvinists, but it is *no* Lutheran doctrine, from the fact that both Luther and Melanchthon taught *the contrary*, and that multitudes of Lutherans, not being bound by any confession on the subject, teach *the renewal and perpetuity* of the earth.
>p. 427 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 1
### No direct passage teaches the annihilation of the earth
>Obs. 2. It is admitted that there is *no direct passage* within the lids of the Bible which teaches the annihilation of the earth.
>p. 428 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 2

>... neither the early Jewish nor Gentile churches taught the inferences so confidently advanced by moderns concerning the results of that fire.
>p. 428 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 2
### Concessions by opponents
>Obs. 3. In this discussion the reader will not fail to notice the important concessions made by many of our opponents.
>p. 430 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 3

>Calvin correctly says (*Insti.*, ch. 25, s. 9), “*Christ will come, not for the destruction of the world, but for purposes of salvation;*" and in sec. 11 advocates a complete restoration.
>p. 430 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 3

>... able and learned men, largely addicted to spiritualizing, find it *impossible*, without direct antagonism, to indorse either the daring speculation of annihilation, or the equally bold conjecture that the new creation refers to the third heaven.
>p. 430 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 3

>Origen, in the same book (*De Prin.*, B. 6, ch. 6, s. 4), rejects the idea of annihilation or utter destruction, fully endorsing a renewal. Thus *the very man*, to whom we are the most indebted for influencing, by his system of interpretation, the obscuring of the truth on this and other points, frankly admits in one aspect the Jewish and Early Church view of renewal and perpetuity.
>p. 430 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 3
### The Word declares the perpetuity of the earth
>Obs. 4. The Word expressly declares the *continuance and perpetuity* of the earth, and no one should venture a counter statement without the same is presented in similar positive terms.
>p. 431 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 4

Ps. 104:5,
Ps. 148:3, 5, 6; Eccl. 1:4; Ps. 89:36; Jer. 31:35,
Jer. 33:25, 26,
Ps. 89:34-37.
### Additional reasons for the perpetuity of the earth
>1. (1) The Early Church, having the advantage of apostolic teaching on a subject which excited *special attention*, held, as far as known, to the same. 
>2. (2) Taking the Millennial descriptions as a whole, *without forcibly separating* them, they clearly teach a purification, renewal, and perpetuity. 
>3. (3) The promise individually to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, *to inherit the land*, and the same promise to the saints, imply it. 
>4. (4) The praying of God’s will to be done *on earth as in heaven*— which we know will never be done in the mixed condition of the Church and world down to the Second Advent—infers it 
>5. (5) The harvest at *the end of the age*, by a comparison of the Scriptures bearing on it, teaches it. 
>6. (6) Separate prophecies which speak of the perpetuity of the Kingdom, etc., *after the Advent of Christ*, such as Dan. 7, Isa. 65 and 66, etc., cannot be consistently explained on any other ground. 
>7. (7) The same truth is contained in the predictions, that He shall have all rule, all enemies under Him, etc., *after* His Sec. Advent, He being at the same time the Restorer. 
>8. (8) *The Pre-Mill. Advent*, with the results attending it here on earth, evince the same. 
>9. (9) The throne and Kingdom—the inheritance of David’s Son, cannot be received, *as covenanted*, unless the perpetuity of the earth after His Coming is upheld. In brief, 
>10. (10) the restitution, the heirship of the world (Rom. 4:13), removal of the curse, the predicted reign of the saints on the earth, the occurrences after the Millennial era, as related by John and the prophets, etc., *all inculcate* the same truth.
>p. 432 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 5
### Not blotted out of existence
>Obs. 6. Besides this, it may well be asked whether an earth so highly honored by the birth, presence, sufferings, and death of Christ (and which is His also by inheritance), *can possibly* be blotted out of existence.
>p. 432 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 6
### Requisite in perfecting His redemptive work
>Obs. 7. The renewal and perpetuity of the earth is requisite *to secure the Redeemer’s glory, in the perfecting of His Redemptive work*, etc.
>p. 433 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 7
### Bible begins and ends in this manner
>Obs. 8. The proposition is apparent even from the manner in which the Bible *begins and ends*. It commences with *an earthly Paradise* lost, *an earth* cursed; it ends with *an earthly Paradise* regained through Christ, just as Milton, Cowper, Heber, C. Wesley (and other poets), but above all the sacred writers, so sweetly describe.
>p. 434 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 8

>"It is important for us to recur to Adam’s original condition, *as we expect all things to be brought back again to that*.” Man’s fall is *on the earth*, and his recovery is *on the earth* and, therefore, *the earth itself* is called upon *to rejoice and exult* in witnessing his glorious restoration.
>-- Luther
>p. 434 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 8
### Numerous Bible promises based on perpetuity of the earth
>Obs. 9. The perpetuity of the earth is so much taken for granted, is so undoubted, that numerous promises *are based upon it*. Thus e.g. "*Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.*"
>p. 434 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 9
### Perpetuity of the earth frankly admitted by anti-millenarians
>Obs. 10. The perpetuity of the earth is so frankly admitted and even advocated in works *especially intended* against Millenarianism, that it seems to require no additional proof.
>p. 436 Vol. 2 Prop. 141 Obs. 10

>Various writers have held that, whatever changes or transformations may ensue hereafter at the consummation, the earth’s continuance will not be interfered with even by a destruction as great as that occasioned by the flood, alleging as proof Gen. 8:21, 22.
