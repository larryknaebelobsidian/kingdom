# Proposition 167. The re-establishment of this Kingdom embraces also the reception of a New Revelation of the Divine Will.

### Props Mentioned
154 156 166 171

>This *necessarily* results, for while the Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom is restored, its restoration is accompanied by great and wonderful changes. The inaugurated rule of the Theocratic King, as predicted, the participation of the saints in such rule, the worldwide extent of the Kingdom, the supremacy of the Jewish nation, the entering upon a new age or dispensation, the change that will result in the condition of believers in this Kingdom, etc., *calls for a revelation* by which not only the official position of the saints is to be governed, but that of the Jewish and Gentile nations is to be controlled.
>p. 29 Vol. 3 Prop. 167
### Sufficiency of Scripture down to the Second Advent
>Obs. 1. The reader will observe that our entire argument insists upon the present and continued sufficiency of Revelation down to the Sec. Advent, over against St. Simonians, Friends of Light, Swedenborgians, Mystics, Mormons, Spiritualists, etc. The Scriptures, as we now have them, are not only the highest but the last Revelation down to that period; and, hence, we reject all others, no matter by whom presented or by what argument enforced. *Until* the arrival of the Bridegroom, there is *a sufficiency* given to gather out and guide the elect. Nothing is lacking to meet the Divine Purpose respecting this dispensation, either in the way of instruction, motive, encouragement, etc.; and, therefore, it is unreasonable to anticipate another Revelation *until* we enter another and more glorious dispensation.
>p. 29 Vol. 3 Prop. 167 Obs. 1
### Future revelation anticipated
>Obs. 2. The Theocracy under David’s Son and Lord, being God’s own ordering, will embrace in some *formal manner* God’s Will in regard to it.
>...
>so permeated are the promises pertaining to this era with the idea that God shall then specially and more abundantly *reveal His Will*, that it is made the matter of praise and rejoicing.
>p. 30 Vol. 3 Prop. 167 Obs. 2
### At Mt. Sinai
>Obs. 3. The Revelation respecting the Theocratic ordering, (viz., the manner of organization, etc.) originally was given outside of Palestine at Mt. Sinai. So also the special Revelation concerning the restored Theocratic arrangement will again be given at Mt. Sinai (See Prop. 166).
>p. 30 Vol. 3 Prop. 167 Obs. 3
### New Revelation (not adapted old)
>Obs. 4. This feature enables us to meet an objection urged by some against our view, viz., that Revelation as now existing, would not be adapted (as e.g. in its requirements) to such an age and kingdom as we advocate. This is freely admitted; for Revelation as now given *only* brings us down to the restitution of things under Christ, and *when* the forfeited blessings are restored, *then*, of course, another Revelation of the will of God *pertaining to the order of that age* is to be anticipated.
