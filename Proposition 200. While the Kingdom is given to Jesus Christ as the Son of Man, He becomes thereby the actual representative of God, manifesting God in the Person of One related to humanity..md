>When the Theocracy was first established, the earthly Ruler (i.e., God acting as such) was separate (i.e. in personality) from the subordinate human ruler (as e.g. God was separate and distinct from the subordinate ruler David), but in this revived form it is God’s Purpose to have both joined, firmly united in the same person. This wonderful Plan proposes that there shall be a real Son of David united and identified with the Godhead, thus constituting Him just such a Ruler as a ‘perfected Theocratic Kingdom on earth should possess to make it powerful and absolute, related both to God and man.

>Obs. 1. This again brings out prominently the doctrine respecting the Person of Christ—a significant one too as the day is approaching.

>such a union of natures, as was sustained before His death and continued unimpaired after it, evermore remains.

>The same Jesus that the disciples saw ascend to heaven shall come again in like manner, unchanged. The same Son of David that ascended must also descend, or else the covenant cannot be realized. Indeed the entire tenor of the Word evinces this, that since his ascension there has been no conversion of human nature into the Divine

>this same Jesus, the true Son of God and of David, so distinctive in both divine and human, is yet destined to manifest Himself in a way (i.e. Theocratic order) by which it will be seen that the Son of David is to perform, in the future, a transcendent part in the history of the world.

Even now it has been observed by various writers that the idea of humanity united with the divine and realized in Christ, is the Key to Protestant theology; but our argument shows, that when the still future manifestation of the same is properly considered, it forms the Key of Redemption, perfected salvation, Theocratic relationship, and the history of the world. It is the goal toward which all things are tending—the culmination of God’s Purpose in government and restitution.
>Obs. 3

>In this Theocratic representation alone, do we find the chasm between the Infinite and Finite completely and satisfactorily filled.
>Obs. 4

>According to “the sure mercies of David” the Finite ever remains with the Infinite, and it is the pleasure of the Infinite to glorify, and manifest itself through, the Finite.
