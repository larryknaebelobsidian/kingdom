# Proposition 200. While the Kingdom is given to Jesus Christ as the Son of Man, He becomes thereby the actual representative of God, manifesting God in the Person of One related to humanity.

>When the Theocracy was first established, the earthly Ruler (i.e., God acting as such) was separate (i.e. in personality) from the subordinate human ruler (as e.g. God was separate and distinct from the subordinate ruler David), but in this revived form it is God’s Purpose to have both joined, firmly united in the same person. This wonderful Plan proposes that there shall be a real Son of David united and identified with the Godhead, thus constituting Him just such a Ruler as a ‘perfected Theocratic Kingdom on earth should possess to make it powerful and absolute, related both to God and man.

>Obs. 1. This again brings out prominently the doctrine respecting the Person of Christ—a significant one too as the day is approaching.

>such a union of natures, as was sustained before His death and continued unimpaired after it, evermore remains.

>The same Jesus that the disciples saw ascend to heaven shall come again in like manner, unchanged. The same Son of David that ascended must also descend, or else the covenant cannot be realized. Indeed the entire tenor of the Word evinces this, that since his ascension there has been no conversion of human nature into the Divine

>this same Jesus, the true Son of God and of David, so distinctive in both divine and human, is yet destined to manifest Himself in a way (i.e. Theocratic order) by which it will be seen that the Son of David is to perform, in the future, a transcendent part in the history of the world.
>Obs. 3

>this same Jesus, the true Son of God and of David, so distinctive in both divine and human, is yet destined to manifest Himself in a way (i.e. Theocratic order) by which it will be seen that the Son of David is to perform, in the future, a transcendent part in the history of the world. Even now it has been observed by various writers that the idea of humanity united with the divine and realized in Christ, is the Key to Protestant theology; but our argument shows, that when the still future manifestation of the same is properly considered, it forms the Key of Redemption, perfected salvation, Theocratic relationship, and the history of the world. It is the goal toward which all things are tending—the culmination of God’s Purpose in government and restitution.
>Obs. 3

>In this Theocratic representation alone, do we find the chasm between the Infinite and Finite completely and satisfactorily filled.
>Obs. 4

>According to “the sure mercies of David” the Finite ever remains with the Infinite, and it is the pleasure of the Infinite to glorify, and manifest itself through, the Finite.
>Obs. 4

>Obs. 5. This Kingdom being different from (although given and sustained by) the Divine Sovereignty of God evinced in Creation, etc., and being a restoration of the Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom, which takes the place of human governments, it follows, that it demands, in consistency, the manifestation of God in the character of an earthly Ruler, and this is done in the Person of the Christ.”

>The Kings of Israel acted as vicegerents of the Theocracy, and hence the earthly vicegerent, who acted as God’s representative in the Kingdom, was specially anointed, consecrated, or set apart for the office by God Himself, and was known by the honorable and significant title of “God’s anointed” and “the Lord’s anointed.” But notice in the Person of Jesus, anointed for this purpose, this Theocratic representation assumes its highest and purest form, for what the former Theocratic King (as David, Solomon, etc.), could only do as vicar, by acting as deputy, Jesus Christ performs as a real Representative of God—God being united personally with Him. Hence the glory and blessedness of this Theocracy.
>Obs. 5

>Obs. 6. Jesus, therefore, invariably represents Himself as manifesting the Father; that whosoever (as e.g. Thomas) has seen Him has seen the Father also; that He is One with the Father; that He is the expressed image of God; all which is founded in His being the contemplated Theocratic personage.

>interchangeably called Christ’s Kingdom, the Father’s Kingdom, and the Kingdom, of God and His Christ.
>Obs. 6

>Obs. 7. Consequently attention is again called to the fact, that the humanity of Jesus, the groundwork of covenanted promise, is never lost sight of, but is brought forward in the most prominent manner as an essential factor in redemption. As the Son of Man, He forgives sins and performs miracles (e.g. Matt. 9:6); He is Lord over the Sabbath day (Matt. 12:8); He is the Mighty One (Matt. 13:41); He is to come and sit on the Throne of His glory (Math. 25:31); He is ordained to be the Judge of the World (Acts 17:31). From these and similar Scriptures, we find that, in the strictest agreement with the covenant and the Kingdom promised to David’s Son, the humanity of Jesus must be placed in the biblical position, as the appointed means of manifesting God to us Theocratically in purposes of Salvation still future.

>the phrase Son of Man “when applied to our great Redeemer denotes His human nature, and at the same time conveys an idea of that glorious Kingdom over which He was in His nature to preside”
>Obs. 7

>this Son of Man is, in the highest, noblest sense, the actual, visible representative of God on the earth,
>Obs. 7

>Obs. 8. Hence, too, arises the significancy of the name “Immanuel” given Matt. 1:23, to the Son of Man.

>it recalls, and compresses into a single word, the covenanted Theocratic Kingdom in which, as its leading characteristic, God shall be truly and really with us.
>Obs. 8

>Obs. 9. This subject is also suggestive why the Son of Man is now placed at the right hand of God.

>Obs. 10. The reader will readily perceive that with such a Representative Ruler—Theocratic in Person and Office—two things will inevitably be secured. (1) The faithfulness of the Theocratic King. ... (2) The stability of the Theocracy.

>Obs. 11. Let the student reflect: if the Lord Jehovah did not consider it derogatory to His honor and glory to act (as a multitude of able writers admit) in the capacity of an earthly Ruler under the initiatory form of the Theocracy, how then can it be derogatory to the honor and glory of the Son of Man, David’s Son, to come and act in a like capacity?
