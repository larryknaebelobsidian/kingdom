>Three cautions are in place here: 
>
>(1) Not to disconnect what the prophets have linked together as belonging to the same period of time here on earth. 
>
>(2) Not to imagine that everything mentioned is to be instantaneously or quickly performedâ€”time being required for the full realization of what may be commenced at the beginning of this age. The exceeding brevity and sometimes obscure allusions admonish us to be guarded in our deductions. 
>
>(3) Not to force an interpretation which is directly opposed by other Scriptures, and then leave the same without the least attempt at reconciliation.
