# Proposition 71. The language of the Apostles confirmed the Jews in their Messianic hopes of the Kingdom.

>This is seen (1) from their employing the Jewish phraseology used to designate the Messianic times; (2) from their applying these to the future advent of Jesus, and urging their hearers to expect that such a Coming will fulfil the prophets; (3) from the fact that the Christianized Jews, in their respective congregations, held both to this Sec. Advent (having received Jesus as the Messiah), and to the restoration of the Davidic throne and Kingdom at the second appearing of Jesus.
### Confirmed by able writers and church history
>Obs. 1. This is admitted by the ablest writers, not only infidels but by such men as Neander. It is corroborated by the church history of the earliest period, informing us, without any dissent, that, so far as known, all the Jewish believers held precisely the views that we are defending.
>...
>This is seen in employing, as e.g. “the times of restitution,” “the world to come,” “redemption,” “salvation,” “the age to come,” “the day of the Lord,” “the day of Christ,” etc., and without any indicated change of meaning apply them to the Sec. Advent of Jesus, who is the Messiah. This application naturally and logically led the Jewish believers to fix their fond expectations of the Kingdom upon the Sec. Coming, and not on the First. In this, as we have shown in preceding Propositions, they only legitimately followed the divine teaching of Jesus Himself who declared that His Kingdom was postponed (e.g. Prop. 66, 58, etc.) to the time of His Coming again.
### Only a Jewish or Chiliastic view is possible
>Obs. 2. After such appeals as Paul makes (Acts 26:6, 7, 8) to the Jewish hope (Prop. 182; after linking the Jewish “Rest” with the Coming Messiah (Prop. 143); after uniting the Jewish view of Judgeship and Judgment with the Second Advent of Jesus (Props. 132, 133, and 134); after making the Millennial glory dependent upon the future Advent (Props. 120 and 121); after joining the restoration of the Jewish nation with Christ’s return (Props. Ill, 112, 113, 114); after endorsing and enforcing the Jewish first resurrection as preceding the glorious Messianic times (Props. 125-129); after all these, and similar points of union, it is difficult to see how men and women with Jewish views, holding tenaciously to covenant and prophecy, could possibly understand the apostles in any other sense than a Jewish or Chiliastic one. Let the reader consider that this agreement is found not merely in one or two things but runs through a great variety, even embracing all the distinguishing peculiarities of a restored Davidic throne and Kingdom under the Messiah.
### Apostle's sermons
>Obs. 3. The language of the apostles is in such harmony with the views of the Jews respecting the Messianic Kingdom, that our opponents, instead of giving any explicit passages, are driven to infer an existing Kingdom; and this very illogical inference, as we have repeatedly shown, involves them in numerous inconsistencies and contradictions.
>...
>How can Fairbairn and others, who so modernize Peter’s two sermons, account for the belief of the very churches to which Peter preached; a faith which constantly looked for a kingdom still future and one that should bear the significant and unmistakable marks of covenant and prophetic promise.
### Apostle's writings
>Obs. 4. The apostles, in their writings, constantly speak of the Kingdom as something that was well understood and fully comprehended as to meaning. Nowhere do we find the modern explanation and definition given, to it; and, according to our argument, being covenanted and fully described by the prophets, it needed no such additions, being already clearly apprehended.
>...
>The truth is that it required no such explanations, for the apostles were addressing persons to whom the Old Test, was familiar, to whom the covenants and Kingdom were well known; and hence they labored to show that this Jesus was the Messiah, that at His Sec. Coming the predicted restitution and Kingdom would appear, and that to secure entrance into that Kingdom repentance and faith in that Coming Christ were indispensable.
