### Unconditional promises of restoration
>Obs. 1. The only objection of force that can be urged against our view is, that these promises of restoration are conditional, but this has been met under Props. 18 and 46-52.
>...
>It is a fact of weight in this discussion to note, that a vast number of writers, opposed to our doctrine, and inclined to spiritualize the predictions as much as possible, are still forced by the singularly effective language of the prophets to admit a restoration of the Jews to their own land.
### Election of the nation Israel
>Obs. 2. This too is shown by the election of this Jewish nation (see Props. 24, 54, 55, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, etc., on Election). No nation on earth, saving the Jewish, has God chosen, over whom He condescends to act in the capacity of an earthly Ruler. No nation save it alone has been thus favored with a Theocratic rule.
### Restoration linked with Kingdom of the Messiah
>Obs. 3. It is important to keep in view, in the consideration of this subject, that the Jews, living at the time of the First Advent and afterward, believed that the prophets linked a complete restoration of the nation with the Kingdom of the Messiah.
### All Jews believed the kingdom was linked to the complete restoration of the nation
>Obs. 4. The Jews, influenced by the plain language of Covenant and prophecy, universally held that the Messianic Kingdom was to be accompanied by a complete restoration of the nation; both ideas were inseparably united, the one being regarded an impossibility without the other.

>A glance at various passages—keeping in mind the existing belief of the hearers—is amply sufficient to show this distinctly. Thus e.g. 
>1. “the regeneration” Matt.” 19:28, 
>2. the removal of the desolation from “the house” Matt. 23:37-39, 
>3. the Messianic reign over the house of Jacob on the throne of David, Luke 1:32, 33, 
>4. the deliverance from enemies, Luke 1:74, 
>5. the removal of Jerusalem’s down-trodden condition when the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled, Luke 21:24, 
>6. the times of refreshing and restitution, Acts 3:19-21, 
>7. the rebuilding again of the fallen-down Davidic tabernacle, Acts 15:16, 
>8. the Jewish hope to be realized, Acts 26:6, 7, etc.—
>all is adapted to strengthen the hope of ultimate restoration, just as Covenant and prophecy promise. Hence we need not be surprised at the Apostolic and Primitive Church cleaving to such a future restoration at the Sec. Advent of the Messiah.

### New Test. speaks less of restoration than Old Test.
>Obs. 5. As in the following Props, our proof, given in detail, shall be mainly drawn from the Old Test., it may be well to state why the New Test, does not enter into the subject of the restoration so extendedly as the Old.
>...
>1. (1) It is taken for granted that the instruction of the New will be combined with the Old (both being one, etc., comp. Prop. 16), where a sufficiency is given to every one who will “search the Scriptures.” 
>2. (2) The union of the doctrine of the restoration with the events of the Second Advent make it easy for any believer to join the declarations of the Old with those of the New Test. 
>3. (3) In the condition of the early Church and of the Jewish nation at, and after, the First Advent, a more detailed statement would unnecessarily (in view of the lengthy postponement) have prejudiced the Roman Power (already embittered) against the nation and Church.

### Two remarkable forms of expression of the restoration
>Obs. 6. In view of the elect position of the nation (Prop. 24) and its consequent Theocratic position, the restoration is so essential, such a prerequisite, that two remarkable forms of expression are employed to indicate it. 
>1. (1) God restores the nation for His own sake, to vindicate His covenant-keeping mercy, and thus magnify His own name. ... Ezek. 36:22 ...
>2. (2) He will do it for the Father’s sake, in behalf of that portion who have been believing and God-fearing. ... Rom. 11:28 ... Lev. 26:42-45
