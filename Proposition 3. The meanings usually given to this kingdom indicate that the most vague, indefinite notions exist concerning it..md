> For many centuries, under the interpretation given by men who have, probably unconsciously, largely imbibed the spirit of the Alexandrian school, the kingdom has been made to mean a variety of things at the option of the writer.
> p. 39 Vol 1 Prop. 3

> Indeed, no doctrine of the Bible has fared so badly through mere fancy, imagination, enthusiasm, and fanaticism as that of the kingdom.
> p. 44 Vol 1 Prop. 3 Obs. 7 note


> They are as little agreed concerning its beginning as in its meaning.
> . . .
>is it not remarkable that a kingdom of God, so distinctively covenanted and predicted, should be so indefinite in its commencement that eminent and pious men are unable to point out its beginning with any degree of absolute certainty?

>unknown to Scripture, and based solely on assertion
> p. 44 Vol 1 Prop. 3 Obs. 8

> In the following pages, it will be shown, step by step, that the kingdom of God did previously exist on earth, that it does not apply to the existing Church, and that the kingdom of Jesus Christ, when established, is **not new** but **a renewal** with precious, astounding additions.
> p. 45 Vol 1 Prop. 3 Obs. 9

> it must be acknowledged, that when comparing the early Church doctrine of the kingdom with the meanings now so extensively given and adopted, **a wide departure** from the original and primitive meaning is fully evidenced.
> p. 45 Vol 1 Prop. 3 Obs. 10

> we have still **a sufficiency** to guide us.  God foresaw this diversity, and hence accommodated Himself to our weakness in **the plain, grammatical language and sense** in which He expresses Himself.  But unfortunately we are prone, in our superior wisdom, to overlook this fact, and arrogate to ourselves the higher power **of adding** to the grammatical meaning **our own constructions** of what the sense ought to be, and thus plunge ourselves into hopeless embarrassments.
> p. 45 Vol 1 Prop. 3 Obs. 11

> The only way to rid ourselves of these ill-defined and antagonistic explanations, is to adopt **legitimate principles of interpretation**, and then carefully, in detail, examine the original covenants and promises upon which the kingdom is based ; and if we have obtained a definition **strictly in accordance** with these, **never** to depart from the same, without the most express -- not inferential -- proof in hand that a change is denoted.
> p. 46 Vol 1 Prop. 3 Obs. 12

> It is a lamentable fact, that few theologians are to be found who are willing to give **a rigid** scriptural examination to this subject.
>
>Instead of making Holy Writ the standard of interpretation, multitudes, while in **theory** recognizing the Bible as the sole measure of faith, yet **in practice** will take the explanations and Scriptural references given by favorite authors as their reliable guides, without the least attempt to verify, by a personal application to Scripture, their correctness.
