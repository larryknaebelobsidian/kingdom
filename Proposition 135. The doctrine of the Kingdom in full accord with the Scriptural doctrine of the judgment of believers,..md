>The Theocratic Kingdom contemplating for its rulers, associated with the Christ, the saints, must necessarily make provision for the same by a ‘present and future judgment of believers. By this method the requisite qualifications for future kingship and priesthood are made manifest.
>p. 385 Vol. 2 Prop. 135

>It is self-evident that any one accounted worthy of the better resurrection”—that pre-eminent res. alone attributed to the righteous—and any one deemed holy enough for a translation at the Sec. Advent, must, in view of such a decided preference shown to them, be the subject of an *antecedent* judgment. How else can it be known that they possess the qualifications requisite for such honor and blessedness? Both the resurrection and translation are represented as a sudden, instantaneous change, and demand a *previous* preparedness for the same. The same is true of the saints coming with Jesus at His open Parousia, for “all the saints” (Zech. 14:5) come with Him. To attain this honor, *an antecedent* estimate of character must have preceded. So also the saints are to be associated with Jesus in the judgment of the world (1 Cor. 6:2), for “this honor have all the saints” (Ps. 149:9), This Judgeship necessarily implies the *previous* judgment of these saints in order to evidence their fitness for so high and responsible a position.

>Pre Millenarians firmly hold that all men, both the righteous and wicked, will be judged, not only in this life but in the future. The passages teaching this are numerous and emphatic, such e.g. as Heb. 9:27; Rom. 2:2-16; Matt. 12:36; 1 Pet. 4:4,5, etc. But, as already shown, there is *an order* in this judgment, just as there is an order in the resurrection.

### Believers are judged

>On the other hand, believers are also represented as judged in the future, not as to their worthiness to receive “*eternal life*,” not as to their forming *a co-heirship* with Jesus (for all this, owing to their union with Christ and subsequent justification, has already been decided), but to ascertain *the exact position* of rulership, Kingship, and priesthood, to which *they are justly entitled*.

Luke 19:17,19
And he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to be in authority over ten cities.’ 18 Then the second came, saying, ‘Your mina, master, has made five minas.’ 19 And he said to him also, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’

Matt. 25:21,23
His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ 22 “Also the one who _had received_ the two talents came up and said, ‘Master, you handed two talents over to me. See, I have gained two more talents.’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’

1 Cor. 15:41
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.

>A passage most decisive and worthy of serious consideration is the one found in 1 Cor. 3:10-15. Here we have the following evidence corroborative of the correctness of our view. 
>(1) This is a judgment *exclusively* of believers, who build upon the foundation laid, Jesus. 
>(2) All who have this foundation and build upon it *are saved*. 
>(3) But *some*, in securing this salvation, “*suffer loss*,” while others “*shall receive a reward*." 
>(4) The reception of reward is *conditioned* on the fact that they build precious, enduring material on this foundation. 
>(5) The endurance of *loss* is caused by the worthless material placed on the foundation. 
>(6) “Every man’s work shall *be made manifest*,” for it will be tested “of what sort it is.” This is only illustrating the principle previously (v. 8) announced, “every man shall receive his own reward *according to his own labor*.” Now, to receive a reward for building “gold, silver, and precious stones” on this foundation is not to attain simply eternal life, for those who also build “wood, hay, and stubble” on it secure the same, but, following the Scripture *analogy of faith*, it must relate to *position* in rulership and to a corresponding *loss* in rank. The only rational, consistent interpretation is that which here finds that one, owing to faithfulness, etc., obtains a more elevated rank, a higher reward than another. All obtain a glorious prize (1 Cor. 9:24), but not all the highest prize (Phil. 3:14); all obtain an entrance into the Kingdom, but one a more “*abundant entrance*" (1 Pet. 1:11) than others.

>It is in virtue of this future judgment according to works, that believers are so urgently pressed to good works. God sees *how largely* their future glory and honor depend upon the character now formed, that repeatedly and perseveringly, yea constantly, this is brought to their attention. Take e.g. Col. 3:4, 5, 8, 9, 24; 1 Thess. 3:12, 13, and 5:4-8; Tit. 2:12,13; 1 Pet. 1:7-15; 2 Pet. 3:11,12, and many others, and they show God’s *deep interest* in our future welfare, that as “little children, we may abide in Christ, that when He shall appear, *we may have confidence, and not be ashamed at His Coming*” (1 John 2:8); that “*our love may be made perfect, so that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment*” (1 John 4:17). Good works now glorify God (Matt. 5:16), qualify for usefulness and happiness (2 Tim. 2:21; Tit. 3:8), etc., and they do not lose these essentials in the world to come; for, sanctifying unto honor and making us the more meet for the Master’s use, they contribute to glorify the Father, Son, and Spirit. And no one can plead inability to perform them, since “*God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work*” 2 Cor. 9:8 (comp. Phil. 2:12; 2 Thess. 2:17; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 13:20, 21; Eph. 2:10, etc.). We may rest assured that “*God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labor of love*” (Heb. 6:10), but will abundantly, through His wonderful grace, verify His promises, “*glory, honor, and peace to every man that worketh good*” (Rom. 2:10). Therefore, Gal. 6:9, “*Let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not*;” 2 John 8, “*Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought (gained), but that we receive a full reward*.”
