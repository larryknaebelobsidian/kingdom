# Proposition 53. The genealogies of our Lord form an important link in the comprehension of this Kingdom.

>This is seen already from what preceded. A throne and a kingdom is to be given to a promised son of David, a regular descendant of Abraham’s. It is his by right of inheritance. He is the royal Theocratic heir. Hence without such a genealogy something *essential* would be lacking in the chain of evidence.
>p. 352 Vol. 1 Prop 53
### Purposely supplied link
>Obs. 1. This link is purposely supplied, and with special reference to these covenants. This is observable in Matthew commencing his table by asserting that Jesus was “the Son of David, the Son of Abraham," i.e. both covenants, the Abrahamic and Davidic, were thus realized in the person of Jesus Christ. Also in designating “David the King,” and omitting it in the descendants; the same expression is significant only when the royal covenant which made David’s throne and Kingdom sure is taken into consideration (comp. Judge Jones’s “Notes” on Matt., ch. 1, for some excellent suggestions). The Kingdom is covenanted to a legal descendant, and this legal descent is clearly traced, showing the legal, divine right of Jesus to the Theocratic throne and Kingdom.
### Identified as Saviour and Messiah and rightful heir
>Obs. 2. If the Saviour was merely to descend from David, to take human nature in that line for the purpose of redemptive work at the First Advent, and then that was to be the finale of the matter, why lay so much stress on descent from the royal line?
>...
>We, therefore, hold that there is a solid, sublime reason why those tables, so uninteresting to many, are given, viz.: not merely to identify Jesus as the Saviour, but to identify Him as the One, *the Messiah*, who has *the lawful right* to David’s Theocratic throne. The throne is not typical, not representative, not symbolical, but *actually and really covenanted* to this Heir, and hence the tables truthfully and actually show how by course of descent *He is the rightful Heir* (comp. Prop. 122).
>p. 353 Vol. 1 Prop 53 Obs. 2
### Jesus' geneology assures certainty of future promises
>Jesus, according to Matthew, is a legal successor to the throne of David.
>p. 354 Vol. 1 Prop 53 Obs. 3

>Luke’s table proceeds more on the principle of tracing His descent through progenitors who were the paternal stem of Him who was the heir.
>p. 354 Vol. 1 Prop 53 Obs. 3

>Now, seeing that the promise has been *so literally* fulfilled in Christ’s descent, in His being the legal Heir to the throne and Kingdom, we hold that such a fulfilment gives us *the strongest assurance* that *the remainder* of the promise will likewise, in God’s ordering and time, be realized.
