>This is seen already from what preceded. A throne and a kingdom is to be given to a promised son of David, a regular descendant of Abraham’s. It is his by right of inheritance. He is the royal Theocratic heir. Hence without such a genealogy something *essential* would be lacking in the chain of evidence.
>p. 352 Vol. 1 Prop 53

>We, therefore, hold that there is a solid, sublime reason why those tables, so uninteresting to many, are given, viz.: not merely to identify Jesus as the Saviour, but to identify Him as the One, *the Messiah*, who has *the lawful right* to David’s Theocratic throne. The throne is not typical, not representative, not symbolical, but *actually and really covenanted* to this Heir, and hence the tables truthfully and actually show how by course of descent *He is the rightful Heir* (comp. Prop. 122).
>p. 353 Vol. 1 Prop 53 Obs. 2

>Jesus, according to Matthew, is a legal successor to the throne of David.
>p. 354 Vol. 1 Prop 53 Obs. 3

>Luke’s table proceeds more on the principle of tracing His descent through progenitors who were the paternal stem of Him who was the heir.
>p. 354 Vol. 1 Prop 53 Obs. 3

>Now, seeing that the promise has been *so literally* fulfilled in Christ’s descent, in His being the legal Heir to the throne and Kingdom, we hold that such a fulfilment gives us *the strongest assurance* that *the remainder* of the promise will likewise, in God’s ordering and time, be realized.
