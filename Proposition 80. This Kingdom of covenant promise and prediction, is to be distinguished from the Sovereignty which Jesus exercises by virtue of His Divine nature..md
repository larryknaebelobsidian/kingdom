>This is distinctively shown by a simple fact (overlooked by the multitude) that the Kingdom is never promised to Him as “the Son of God” but as (the covenants and predictions demand it) “the Son of Man" or “the Son of David".
### Jesus is Lord over all in his divine nature
>Obs. 1. It may be premised, in order to avoid misconception, that Jesus now in His Divine nature, in His Oneness with the Father, does exercise a dominion over all things. According to this nature He is Lord over all, and this is, in our estimation, most unequivocally taught in such passages as John 1:8; Col. 1:15, 19; Phil.’ 2:9,11; 1 Cor. 8:6; Rom. 11:36; Rev. 1:5-6, etc.

### Divine-Human
>The Theocracy, by incorporating the Davidic kingship, embraces, as the grand instrumentality for its future re-establishment in sublime power and glory, the Divine-Human, now united in Jesus, the Messiah.
>Obs. 1
### Early Chiliasts distinguished between Divine-Human and Sovereignty
>Obs. 2. The early Chiliasts clearly distinguish between the Kingdom belonging to Jesus as the Divine-Human, and the Sovereignty vested in Him as God.
### Early Chiliasts view
>The idea, gathered from their writings, is this: in His Divine capacity He is represented as reigning, but this reign is not the reign of promise;
>Obs. 2
### Kingdom pertains to Divine and Divine-Human (the Christ)
>Obs. 3. When Christ assumes the Kingdom at the time appointed, in view of His being the predicted seed of David, this does not by any means cause Him to lay aside the Sovereignty that He has with the Father over the universe. As Divine He is with the Father evermore, but as the Divine-human, He manifests Himself (and the Father through Him) on earth in a specified form of reigning adapted to humanity. Hence the predicted Kingdom is something that pertains not; merely to the Divine but to “the Christ,” i.e. the Divine-human united.

>The right comes to Him in the covenanted line through the human element (i.e. as the lawful seed of David) delegated by the Divine Sovereignty of the Father and rendered efficacious and Theocratic by the intimate and ever-enduring union of the Divine, thus constituting Him in the highest and purest sense the Theocratic King.
>Obs. 3

### Theologian confusion
>Obs. 4. It is amazing that theologians, without observing the contradiction involved, confound the Divine Sovereignty with the covenanted Kingship of Jesus, and yet acknowledge that Rom. 14:9; Phil. 2:9; Heb. 12:2, etc., teach that “the ground of His dominion is to be found in His obedience unto death, the death of the cross” (so Oosterzee’s Dogmatics). Now certainly the Divine Sovereignty is not grounded in any such contingency, but the Kingship pertaining to Jesus, as the Son of David, is based upon His obedience, etc. (comp. Props. 83 and 84).

### Avoid extremes
>There are some things which essentially belong to Jesus as the Son of God, as One with God; and there are other things which appertain to Him as “the Christ,”  the Divine-human. Two extremes are to be avoided: on the one hand to lay all stress on the Divine, and making, in. this Kingdom, the human too subordinate; and on the other hand pressing the human to the exclusion of the Divine. Both are firmly and eternally united, and the very revelation of the Son of Man, as David’s Son, will necessarily be an attestation to His divinity in the works that He will do, in the power that He will exercise, and in the relation that He sustains to the universe.

### "Son of God" not employed in direct connection with the kingdom
>Obs. 6. As if purposely to guard us against the error which is so largely prevalent, the phrase “Son of God” is not employed in direct connection with the Kingdom of heaven to be set up on earth.

>The predicate “Son of God” is given to show His ability to save, that requisite power is united with the human, as in Rom. 1:1; Heb. 4:14; 1 Jno. 3:8, etc. The predicate “Son of Man” is bestowed to identify Him as truly coming in the covenanted and Theocratic order.
