# Proposition 191. Our doctrine enforced by the general tenor of the Apocalypse.

### Props Mentioned
17 182 183

>The concluding book of the Canon ought to inform us—being a revelation of the future—when and how the glorious promises, covenanted and predicted, pertaining to Christ, the saints, and the world, are to be realized. This it does in complete harmony with the previous teaching of the postponement of the Kingdom, the design of the dispensation, etc.
>p. 382 Vol. 3 Prop. 191
## The coming of Christ
>Obs. 1. The simple fact—no mutter how we may interpret the book as a whole or as to details—that the seals, trumpets, and vials predict such a state of things as only agrees with our teaching, is alone sufficient. Thus e.g. it is only when the seventh and last trumpet sounds that *the Kingdom*, universal, of Jesus is revealed, and—consider it well—linked with (Rev. 11:15-18) angry nations, a time of wrath, of resurrection, and of reward. When the Millennial age itself is introduced (Rev. 20:1-9) it is preceded by the Personal Advent of Jesus and His saints, and the destruction of a mighty confederation of wicked (Rev. 19:11—21). The great revelation of glory, sovereignty, etc., *follows* a series of trial and judgments, in which the Church and the world are both included. No Millennial period, no Kingdom, no triumph, *until the Coming of Jesus*.
>p. 382 Vol. 3 Prop. 191 Obs. 1
## The end result is the Kingdom
>Obs. 2. This book has for its *end* the covenanted and predicted Kingdom of the Messiah. Dr. Lange (*Apoc.*, p. 402) justly asserts: “That it (the Apoc.) is to be recognized as *the most developed phase* of the New Testament doctrine bearing upon its theme—*the hope of the Kingdom of God and the advent of that Kingdom* in the world—although it is couched in Biblico-artistic, allegorical, and symbolical forms."
>p. 382 Vol. 3 Prop. 191 Obs. 1
## He cometh
>Obs. 3. The great theme of Revelation is the one, “*He Cometh*.”
>...
>And in perfect accord with the constant watching posture insisted upon by Jesus and the apostles, and in complete agreement with no intervening Millennial age, the very last caution and injunction is (Rev. 22:7, 12, 20), “*Behold, I come quickly*;” “*Surely, I come quickly, Amen*.”
>p. 384 Vol. 3 Prop. 191 Obs. 3
## The great object of believers love and hope
>Obs. 4. The introduction, continuation, and conclusion of the book is designed to urge upon every believer that *the great object* of his love and hope is the Sec. Coming of the Lord Jesus.
>p. 384 Vol. 3 Prop. 191 Obs. 4
## Deserves most careful study
>Obs. 5. It follows, therefore, as the Apocalypse is the Revelation of Jesus pertaining to His Churches; His resurrected, translated, and glorified saints; His judgments; His triumph, Kingdom, and reign; His power, majesty, and glory; His bestowal of the greatest blessings in a perfected Redemption—it ought to receive *our heartfelt and most careful study*.
>p. 386 Vol. 3 Prop. 191 Obs. 5
## Sustains under sore trial
>Obs. 6. This Book was specially designed to sustain the Christian and the Church *under sore trial*; its magnificent portrayals of ultimate deliverance, reward, and glory at the Coming of Jesus being most admirably adapted for such a purpose.
