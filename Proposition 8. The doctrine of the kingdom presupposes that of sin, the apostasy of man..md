> The prophets with one voice proclaim, that this kingdom is to be established in order that in it man may find complete, perfect deliverance from sin and evil.  The kingdom is to be set up, so that man and nature may be happily rescued from the curse entailed by sin under which both labor and groan.
> p. 102 Vol. 1 Prop. 8 

> the Bible is a revelation of God's plan *to save man from his fallen condition.*
> p. 102 Vol. 1 Prop. 8 Obs. 1

> The kingdom originates in God's merciful desire to deliver us from the reign and power of sin; to bring us back into a state of *entire restitution and perfect salvation.*
> p. 102 Vol. 1 Prop. 8 Obs. 1

> It is a kingdom which in is preparatory measures calls for repentance of sin (Matt. 3:1), conversion from sin (Matt. 18:3), self-denial of sin (Mark 9:47), perseverance against sin (Luke 9:62), and most emphatically refuses admittance into the kingdom of those who indulge in sin (1 Cor. 6:9,10).
> p. 102 Vol. 1 Prop. 8 Obs. 1

> The introduction of sin and its continued existence is a deep mystery.
> p. 103 Vol. 1 Prop. 8 Obs. 2

> The Bible makes *no effort* to explain it; only speaking of it as a painful *fact*, allowed by the permission of an Omnipotent God, and which shall be by His power ultimately crushed. No labored effort in the way of proof is given by [[inspiration]], but a constant appeal is made *to our own consciousness* of the necessity and truthfulness of Divine interposition in view of *the sense* of moral guilt, the evils to which we are subject, the helplessness and limited duration of man, the otherwise inexorable embrace of nature, etc.  A fundamental teaching on almost every page is this: that man *unaided* cannot deliver himself from sin and its sad consequences, but *imperatively* requires Divine help in his need.
>  p. 103 Vol. 1 Prop. 8 Obs. 2

> We are content to receive the Biblical account that evil is the resultant of a rejection of the theocratic idea (*i.e.*, a violation of God's rule), that it constitutes until god has, my a course of testing, gathered out all the material requisite to establish the theocracy in a most glorious and triumphant manner, and that when all things are prepared, the postponement caused by sin will close by *the complete overthrow of evil* through the appointed King and His co-rulers.
