## What think ye of Christ?

>It has been justly remarked by many writers that the question that Jesus asked (Matt. 22:42) the assembled Pharisees: “What think ye of Christ?” is the great question of the day, seeing that the attack upon and the defence of Christianity, for the last twenty or more years, has centered upon the Person of Jesus Christ.

>The question, “Who is Jesus V’ will be, so far as the world is concerned, decided adversely to Christianity; for we are assured that the time is certainly coming when the Christ ship of Jesus will be denied, the claims of His Messiahship will be ignored and scorned, and Antichrist shall gain, for a brief period, the complete victory in the contest, but, thank God, not by the force of reason or legitimate weapons, but, as the Spirit informs as, by “deceit,” “lying wonders,” “making war with the saints and overcoming them,” and killing all who will not worship him or his image.

### The Son of Man
### The only-begotten Son
>He is the only Theocratic King that was predicted, and that ever shall in the future exist upon this earth.
>Obs. 2

>Hence we insist that Jesus the Christ must, if we will do justice both to the Record and to His Person, be considered in His Theocratic relationship.
>Obs. 2

>one of the distinguishing peculiarities of this promised Messiah is the implied and apparent immortality attributed unto Him, so that the Jews themselves believed and asserted (John 12:34) that He would never die.
>Obs. 2

>The Theocratic ordering necessitates the same, and therefore it is not lacking in the Theocratic King. Again: the Messiah that is covenanted to rule over the Theocratic-Davidic throne and Kingdom is to be possessed with God-like powers in order to bring in the predicted Millennial blessings, and this was so clearly apprehended by the Jews that they looked (John 7:31; Matt. 12:23) for Him to perform uncommonly great miracles.
>Obs. 2

>If He is the Messiah at all, He must exhibit the earnest, at least, of Messianic power so that we may have confidence in Him and in His ability to consummate the predicted Messianic times.
>Obs. 2
