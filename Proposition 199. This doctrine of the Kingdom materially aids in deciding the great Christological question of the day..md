## What think ye of Christ?

>It has been justly remarked by many writers that the question that Jesus asked (Matt. 22:42) the assembled Pharisees: “What think ye of Christ?” is the great question of the day, seeing that the attack upon and the defence of Christianity, for the last twenty or more years, has centered upon the Person of Jesus Christ.

>The question, “Who is Jesus V’ will be, so far as the world is concerned, decided adversely to Christianity; for we are assured that the time is certainly coming when the Christ ship of Jesus will be denied, the claims of His Messiahship will be ignored and scorned, and Antichrist shall gain, for a brief period, the complete victory in the contest, but, thank God, not by the force of reason or legitimate weapons, but, as the Spirit informs as, by “deceit,” “lying wonders,” “making war with the saints and overcoming them,” and killing all who will not worship him or his image.

### The Son of God
### The Son of Man
### The only-begotten Son
>He is the only Theocratic King that was predicted, and that ever shall in the future exist upon this earth.
>Obs. 2

>Hence we insist that Jesus the Christ must, if we will do justice both to the Record and to His Person, be considered in His Theocratic relationship.
>Obs. 2

>one of the distinguishing peculiarities of this promised Messiah is the implied and apparent immortality attributed unto Him, so that the Jews themselves believed and asserted (John 12:34) that He would never die.
>Obs. 2

>The Theocratic ordering necessitates the same, and therefore it is not lacking in the Theocratic King. Again: the Messiah that is covenanted to rule over the Theocratic-Davidic throne and Kingdom is to be possessed with God-like powers in order to bring in the predicted Millennial blessings, and this was so clearly apprehended by the Jews that they looked (John 7:31; Matt. 12:23) for Him to perform uncommonly great miracles.
>Obs. 2

>If He is the Messiah at all, He must exhibit the earnest, at least, of Messianic power so that we may have confidence in Him and in His ability to consummate the predicted Messianic times.
>Obs. 2

>Messiah the Hebrew for Christ was universally understood by the Jews as descriptive of the King, but at present being regarded as “a doctrinal word” it is made to express, not the actual position, official station, and person of Jesus, but the works and blessings received from Him, thus obscuring the original and scriptural idea connected with it.
>Obs. 2

>it is owing to His being “the Christ” that He has power to save, and that when the time comes for the manifestation of His glorious Messianic dignity, He will abundantly save and deliver His people, even taking them out of the now locked gates of Hades. Now we only receive the earnests or pledges of the same; then we shall realize the full meaning of that which faith and hope now only appropriates to the joy and peace of the heart.

### Repeat a few facts
Obs. 3
>Notice 
>1. (1) the expressed determination of God to set up a Theocratic Kingdom given by the prophets in the ages preceding the First Advent; 
>2. (2) this Theocratic Kingdom established in an initiatory form (some of its adjuncts being merely provisionary); 
>3. (3) this Theocracy incorporates the Davidic line, thus more closely in its Headship allying itself with humanity; 
>4. (4) when this incorporation takes place, it is declared by covenant and promise that this Theocratic Kingdom shall be established in a permanent and most glorious form under a descendant of David; 
>5. (5) this Theocratic Kingdom under David and his immediate successors never gains a world ascendency but, on account of the sinfulness of kings and nations, is overthrown; 
>6. (6) the Jewish nation being the covenanted people and the nucleus, owing to covenant relationship in and through whom the Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom can only be manifested, that nation is still preserved; 
>7. (7) the prophets, notwithstanding the downfall of the Kingdom still continue to predict the fulfilment of covenant and promise in the person of a descendant of David at some time in the future, and these predictions involve the restoration of the identical throne and Kingdom overthrown; 
>8. (8) this predicted and covenanted Kingdom is preached and tendered to the Jewish nation, when the promised David’s Son comes by the forerunner John, by the Son Himself and by His disciples, but only conditionally, viz., on repentance; 
>9. (9) this Kingdom, owing to the condition enjoined not being complied with, is then postponed to a future Advent of this Son; 
>10. (10) during this intercallary period 
>	1. (a) the tabernacle of David continues in ruins, 
>	2. (b) the Jewish nation is to be subjected to continued and fearful rejection and a scattering among the nations, 
>	3. (c) Gentile domination is to remain until a certain time has elapsed, 
>	4. (d) a Christian Church is to be established and perpetuated to raise up a seed unto Abraham and prepare for the manifestation of the Kingdom with a moral power and grandeur perfectly overwhelming; 
>11. (11) this Kingdom is always spoken of as still future and identified with the period of the Sec. Advent; 
>12. (12) and in this Kingdom, as realized at the Sec. Advent, the covenant and prophecies are said to be fulfilled, as is seen e.g. in appropriating the descriptions given by these to the Messianic Kingdom which is to be revealed at the Coming again of this same Jesus.

### Objections of unbelief
Obs. 4

### Other objections
Obs. 5

>The Kingdom having been conditionally offered to the nation and having been rejected because the nation remained unrepentant, it was postponed until the Sec. Advent, and therefore, in view of the Divine Purpose previously plainly announced before His death, and thus embracing also a punishment upon the unbelief of the nation, it would have been incompatible with Messianic dignity and purpose to exhibit Himself to any others than believers in Him.
>Obs. 5

### More objections
Obs. 6
>the spiritualizing which tampered with the Messianic idea and the Messianic Kingdom came in later through such men as Origen, etc.; for history records the fact that both of these fundamental ideas were preserved intact by the early believers.
>Obs. 6

>no historical evidence, even the slightest, to prove that the allegorical interpretation of Alexandrian Jews had any influence whatever in forming the primitive views pertaining to the Christ; but, on the other hand, the reception of the Old Test. Scriptures, the retention of the pure Messianic conception, the utterance of various predictions, etc., all to be taken in their proper grammatical meaning, show that the allegorical interpretation met with no favor in the teaching of Jesus or His disciples.
>Obs. 6
