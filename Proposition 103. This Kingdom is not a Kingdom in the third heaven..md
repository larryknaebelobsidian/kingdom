# Proposition 103. This Kingdom is not a Kingdom in the third heaven.

>Some writers, especially in answering Millenarians, inform us that the Kingdom of Christ, of God, or of heaven, is now in heaven, where the redeemed now dwell, and that it will continue to remain there after the resurrection. Aside from its direct conflict, with covenant and promise, it is easily rebutted by Dan. 2 and 7, Rev. 14, etc., which describe the Kingdom as one existing here on earth over the whole world.
### Third heaven kingdom does not meet conditions of prophecy and covenant
>Obs. 1. Whatever the authority and power of Christ in the third heaven in His Divine and human natures (Props. so, 79, 83, etc.), the same does not meet the conditions either of prophecy (Prop. 35, etc.), or, especially, of covenant, Prop. 49.
### Unscriptural interpretation
>Obs. 2. The Kingdom is not, as held by some, e.g. Dr. Lange and others, the church in heaven before the Second Advent in a triumphant state called “the Kingdom of glory.” This theory is derived from mistaking the Divine Sovereignty for *the specially promised Kingdom to the Son of man*, and probably from a desire to cover up what defects may exist in several lower grades or phases of Kingdoms simultaneously in operation. But this is *exceedingly unscriptural*; and the theory can be traced directly to the Origenistic interpretation.

### Early church was looking for the kingdom
>Obs. 4. The early church had no idea that this Kingdom was received *at or after* death (see Prop. 98, 136). Whatever the view concerning the intermediate state, whatever the condition allotted to the pious, one thing is *certainly affirmed*, that they looked for the Kingdom, the inheriting, crowning *at the Second Advent of Christ* and *not* at death. The departed were also represented as *waiting for* the Kingdom, and the whole period during which the bodies of the saints were not restored was characterized as one of expectation, waiting for redemption, Rom. 8:23. The non-crowning of Paul, during the intermediate period, the reception of the Kingdom at the time of “regeneration” or “restitution,” etc., was decisive.
