>The Kingdom is not, as held by some, e.g. Dr. Lange and others, the church in heaven before the Second Advent in a triumphant state called “the Kingdom of glory.” This theory is derived from mistaking the Divine Sovereignty for *the specially promised Kingdom to the Son of man*, and probably from a desire to cover up what defects may exist in several lower grades or phases of Kingdoms simultaneously in operation. But this is *exceedingly unscriptural*; and the theory can be traced directly to the Origenistic interpretation.

>The early church had no idea that this Kingdom was received *at or after* death (see Prop. 98, 136). Whatever the view concerning the intermediate state, whatever the condition allotted to the pious, one thing is *certainly affirmed*, that they looked for the Kingdom, the inheriting, crowning *at the Second Advent of Christ* and *not* at death. The departed were also represented as *waiting for* the Kingdom, and the whole period during which the bodies of the saints were not restored was characterized as one of expectation, waiting for redemption, Rom. 8:23. The non-crowning of Paul, during the intermediate period, the reception of the Kingdom at the time of “regeneration” or “restitution,” etc., was decisive.
