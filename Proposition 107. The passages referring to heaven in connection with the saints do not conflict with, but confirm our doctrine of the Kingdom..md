>In urging this Kingdom it is said that such promises as Matt. 5:12, Matt. 19:21, etc., refer to the third heaven, and from thence it is inferred that the Kingdom is the state of the saved, triumphant Church in heaven. But we have already shown (Prop. 108, etc.) that Covenant and prophecy describe a Kingdom here on the earth “under the whole heaven”; that for wise purposes the Kingdom has been postponed; that Christ now remains in heaven until the period of manifestation arrives; that He comes from, heaven and the Kingdom is inherited—these and other reasons indicate that there is no conflict between the two, but that, as specifically announced (as e.g. Zech. 14:5) the saints come with Him, and then follows the reign over the earth (as e.g. Zech. 14:9)—hence such passages must not be understood as embracing or inferring the Kingdom, itself.
### Many writers concede to earthly promises
>Obs. 1. That large class of writers who concede the renewal of the earth and its occupancy by the saints, etc., do not, of coarse, press these passages to an eternal inheritance and Kingdom in the third heaven. The concessions that they make are all that are requisite for our view (Props. 140-152).
### Kingdom of heaven on earth
>Obs. 2. The meaning of the phrase “Kingdom of heaven,” and its derivation have already been given (Props. 19, 45, etc.); we now only add that those nearest to the latter, viz., the Jews, disciples, and the early Church, found no difficulty in the phrase in applying it to a Kingdom here on earth established under Divine auspices and power.
### Usage of the word "heaven"
>Obs. 3. In the consideration of this subject it must not be overlooked, that “heaven” is employed as a symbol or figure of honor, station, authority, power, and political or civil supremacy.
### Nowhere specified in the third heaven
>Obs. 4. The predicted Kingdom of the Messiah, David’s Son, is nowhere specified to be a Kingdom in the third heaven (Prop. 103), but “of heaven” or rather “of heavens” or “of heavenlies.” According to the Covenant it could not be in heaven, but it is of heaven; that is, given by God, made as God designs it, fashioned after the will of heaven, and containing in itself “heavens,” or “heavenlies," i.e. most eminent stations of power and dominion.
