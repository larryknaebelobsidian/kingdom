# Proposition 48. The Kingdom being based on the covenants, the covenants must be carefully examined, and (Prop. 4) the literal language of the same must be maintained.

### Props Mentioned
4 131 137 141 142 

>The appointment, arrangement, disposition, or institution of a covenant relation, in whatever (as voluntary, a contract, etc.) light it may be regarded, presupposes two parties; the one who promises or imparts, and the other who will receive or attains. In all earthly transactions, when a promise, agreement, or contract is entered into by which one party gives a promise of value to another, it is *universally* the custom to explain such a relationship and its promises *by the well-known laws of language* contained in our grammars or in common usage. It would be regarded absurd and trifling to view them in any other light. (Comp. Prop. 4.)
>p. 290 Vol. 1 Prop. 48
### Earthly covenants require literal language
>Obs. 1. Why, then, should this universal rule be laid aside when coming to the covenants of the Bible?
>p. 290 Vol. 1 Prop. 48 Obs. 1
### Literal covenants can expand over time
>Obs. 2. This, however, does not imply, especially if the covenant is a voluntary one on the part of God and contains His merciful purposes of Salvation, that it may not be briefly expressed or concisely stated, and be afterward enlarged by way of additions, by explaining how it will be performed, etc. All this may, indeed, be attached to it for prudential and wise reasons, and yet, *as far as given*, we are not at liberty to reject the plain meaning presented. And the less so if the additions afterward appended accurately coincide with the express language of the covenants.
>p. 290 Vol. 1 Prop. 48 Obs. 2
### Literal partial fulfillment confirms
>Our Proposition is confirmed by the indisputable fact that God has stamped the grammatical sense as the correct one by *literally fulfilling* a portion of the covenants.
>p. 291 Vol. 1 Prop. 48 Obs. 3
### Not typical
>The promises in the covenants are *not typical* . . .
>The *partial fulfilment* of them clearly shows that they are not to be regarded as typical. 
> p. 291 Vol. 1 Prop. 48 Obs. 4
