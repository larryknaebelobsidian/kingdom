### Nigh kingdom was postponed
>The simple, unvarnished narrative, as firmly held by the Primitive churches, tells us that the Kingdom preached as nigh *was postponed* to the Sec. Advent.
>p. 268 Vol. 1 Prop. 42 Obs. 5

### Influences on Jesus preaching

>The indulgence of the reader is desired while, in this connection, a few points are forestalled. Three things must evidently have weighed upon the mind of Jesus, and thus shaped His style of preaching the Kingdom. 
>1. The fact of the existence of the Roman Government over the Jewish nation, and its jealousy of power. His mission was to the Jews, and He was commissioned to tender the Kingdom to the nation (e.g. Props. 55, 57, etc.), and the Kingdom, according to the Davidic covenant required a Son of David *to restore the throne and Kingdom of David*. This was taught by the Prophets, and believed by the Jews, it was the general, universal belief that when the Messiah came to establish the Kingdom, *He would overthrow Gentile domination* (as He will do at the Sec. Advent, Props. 163 and 164), and thus deliver the Jewish nation from its enemies. In addressing the Jews, it was *unnecessary* to proclaim this Kingdom boldly and freely in the emphatic words of the Prophets, because (1) the Kingdom denoted was *already well known*, as the subject-matter of covenant and promise, to every Jew; and (2) because, foreseeing His rejection by the Jews, *advantage* would inevitably be taken (comp. Prop. 40, Obs. 6, note 1) of it to accuse Him as *a conspirator* against the Roman Power. With all the wisdom and prudence exercised by Him, this, nevertheless, was done, and He was crucified under the charge of being “*the King of the Jews*,” thus implying opposition to Caesar. 
>2. Knowing, as Jesus did, that the offer of the Kingdom must be made (Prop. 55, etc.), that the tender would be rejected (Prop. 57, etc.), and that-the Kingdom itself would be postponed (Props. 58-68), it would, in view of these foreknown circumstances, have been *unwise and impolitic* to have presented the subject of the Kingdom in any other way than that in which it was done. *Sufficiently clear* to test the repentance and faith of the nation, *sufficiently distinct* for those who receive the Word of God without human additions, and *sufficiently precise* to encourage the hope of His people in His Messiahship—*more* would have been *inexpedient*. What was needed in addition He gave to us through John (in Apoc.), and this also in a form that it might not *unnecessarily* excite opposition. Christ’s preaching is influenced by *foreknown results.* 
>3. Foreknowing how the Kingdom would eventually, at His Sec. Advent (Props. 66, 74, 83, 87, etc.), be established, He could accordingly shape and adapt His language, introducing other matter that necessarily preceded the same. While a restoration of the Davidic throne and Kingdom (and as a result the restoration of the Jewish nation to eminence and power) is contemplated, yet, because of the defection of the nation and its long continued punishment, *purposes of mercy* toward the Gentiles were entertained and mentioned, promises to be realized ultimately in the Kingdom were given, encouragements and cautions were presented, etc. This introduced new details, which can only be properly apprehended when taken *in their connection with the whole*.
>p. 270-271 Vol. 1 Prop. 42 Obs. 9 (slightly reformatted to highlight the 3 things mentioned)

> This is a sufficient reply to those who ask why the New Test. is not more specific in mentioning the Davidic throne and Kingdom (although in several places pointedly referred to), for all know the Kingdom intended. This, too, may be a reason why Jesus wrote nothing, lest His writings should be employed, as His reported words were, against Him.  The peculiar surroundings required, in the nature of the case, *great caution* in proclaiming the Kingdom ; and hence language was adopted toward the Jewish nation *sufficiently precise and determinate* for it, having the prophets to understand.  And this prudence was continued by the apostles afterward (as e.g. in linking the Kingdom with the Second Advent, with Supernatural power, etc.), to prevent the Romans from taking unnecessary alarm and persecuting believers.
> p. 271 Vol. 1 Prop. 42 Obs. 9 Note 1

### Strange but wise purpose of God

>The whole matter is purposely so arranged and ordered that *faith alone*— sustained by the fulfilments and a comparison of the Record—can discern the surpassingly strange but pre-eminently wise Purpose of God.
>p. 272 Vol. 1 Prop. 42 Obs. 10

### The topic of preaching was the kingdom

>The *fundamental* idea, forming a bond of union between Jesus and the preceding Revealers of the Purpose of God, is the Kingdom of heaven. This He preached *first*; this He revealed *last* through John the Revelator; this was the *special subject* (Acts 1:3) between Him and the apostles after His resurrection; and hence by it He places Himself in contact with the Prophets, in unison with John the Baptist, in sympathy with His disciples, and stamps Himself as *the great Preacher of the Kingdom*. This suggests that *perfect unity* of Teaching must exist between all these; that no accommodation theory can interpose between His teaching and that of John’s or the Prophets; and that the subject of the Kingdom, being so prominently set forth, must be (Props. 1 and 2) a most interesting topic to every intelligent believer and student.
