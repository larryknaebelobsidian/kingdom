>The Kingdom itself being redemptive in its intent and work, brings deliverance from the curse, however widespread, restores forfeited gifts, and even bestows riches never before conferred upon man or the earth.

>The Plan of Redemption, of which this Kingdom forms the eliminating agency of affecting and completing, contemplates a return to the condition existing before the fall, and even to that which man would have attained to had he not sinned. Of course, it must then include the renewal of creation.

>Obs. 1. One of the striking peculiarities attached to Millennial prophecies describing the establishment of this Kingdom, is, that the land, the earth is represented as participating in the favors of the King; and the joy and happiness of the nations is immeasurably enhanced by their liberal bestowal.

 >Obs. 2. Rom. 8:19-23 deserves particular consideration, seeing that some (as Barnes, Com. loci) are disposed to make “the creature” refer only to believers (renewed), and not to inanimate and animate creation.

>Obs. 3. This leads us to consider whether Paul’s declaration and the Mill, prophecies, etc., include the deliverance of the animal kingdom. This, as is well known, was the position of the early Church, as is evidenced by their writings, especially Tertullian, Lactantius, and the earlier Fathers— Papias, Barnabas, and Justin.

>Millenarians, who generally are satisfied with simply saying that the animal condition (with that of the earth) will be changed for the better, leaving the resurrection as a matter open to conjecture.
>Obs. 3


>a large class of writers, who expressly affirm that creation is to be brought back to its former “paradisiacal state” cannot be comprehended, unless violence is done to their own statements of what redemption is to accomplish, without receiving such a deliverance of the animals.
>Obs. 3
