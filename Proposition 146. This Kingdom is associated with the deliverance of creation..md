# Proposition 146. This Kingdom is associated with the deliverance of creation.

### Props Mentioned
49 119 120 121 125 142 143 144 149 150 152

>The Kingdom itself *being redemptive* in its intent and work, brings deliverance from the curse, however widespread, restores forfeited gifts, and even bestows riches never before conferred upon man or the earth.
>p. 479 Vol. 2 Prop. 146 

>The Plan of Redemption, of which this Kingdom forms *the culminating agency* of affecting and completing, contemplates *a return* to the condition existing before the fall, and even to that which man would have attained to had he not sinned. Of course, it must *then include* the renewal of creation.
>p. 479 Vol. 2 Prop. 146 
### Land and earth participate
>Obs. 1. One of the striking peculiarities attached to Millennial prophecies describing the establishment of this Kingdom, is, that the land, the earth is represented *as participating* in the favors of the King; and the joy and happiness of the nations is immeasurably enhanced by their liberal bestowal.
>p. 480 Vol. 2 Prop. 146 Obs. 1
### Not all views include non-human creation
 >Obs. 2. Rom. 8:19-23 deserves particular consideration, seeing that some (as Barnes, *Com. loci*) are disposed to make “*the creature*” refer only to believers (renewed), and not to inanimate and animate creation.
 >p. 480 Vol. 2 Prop. 146 Obs. 2
### Our view includes the animal kingdom
>Obs. 3. This leads us to consider whether Paul’s declaration and the Mill, prophecies, etc., include the deliverance of *the animal kingdom*. This, as is well known, was the position of the early Church, as is evidenced by their writings, especially Tertullian, Lactantius, and the earlier Fathers— Papias, Barnabas, and Justin.
>p. 483 Vol. 2 Prop. 146 Obs. 3

>... Millenarians, who generally are satisfied with simply saying that the animal condition (with that of the earth) will be changed for the better, leaving the resurrection as a matter open to conjecture.
>p. 484 Vol. 2 Prop. 146 Obs. 3

>... a large class of writers, who expressly affirm that creation is to be brought back to its former “*paradisiacal state*” cannot be comprehended, unless violence is done to their own statements of what redemption is to accomplish, without receiving such a deliverance of the animals.
>p. 484 Vol. 2 Prop. 146 Obs. 3

>Besides this, before the reader comes to a conclusion upon this particular point, let him first pass over the argument respecting the Kingdom; for if the Kingdom of the Messiah is that which we derive from Covenant and Prophecy, from His own words and that of His commissioned preachers, if it contains the restored Jewish nation and the spared Gentile nations, then, indeed, it would be both inconsistent and absurd to have such a Kingdom existing *without the presence of the lower creation*.
>p. 487 Vol. 2 Prop. 146 Obs. 3
### Look back to Genesis
>Obs. 4. As *the curse* is to be repealed, it is necessary to go back to the record in Genesis to ascertain its extent, and from this deduce what the deliverance will affect.
>p. 488 Vol. 2 Prop. 146 Obs. 4
### Complete redemption, full restoration
>Obs. 5. Without pressing this subject into details (which are not given), we ought to be content with the general statements made concerning the deliverance of creation, which are sufficiently extended in their nature to indicate *a completeness of Redemption*, reaching to *a restoration of all the forfeited blessings*.
>p. 490 Vol. 2 Prop. 146 Obs. 5

>Now, the curse has fallen upon the race, and all nations experience its sad consequences, but our doctrine of the Kingdom explicitly teaches that *after* the manifestation or the resurrection of the sons of God, the race, the nations, both Jewish and Gentile, shall be delivered from the heavy pressure of the curse (Prop. 152).
