# Proposition 15. The doctrine of the kingdom can become better understood and appreciated.
### Our understanding of Scripture grows
> Some think that religious truth is stationary, and this is a favorite charge of the enemies of Christianity, upon which is founded the expressions "antiquated," "stale," "worn out," etc. Admitting that any doctrinal matter contained in Holy Writ is final in authority, and that the things of the Spirit are only to be found in their purity in the Revelation given by that Spirit, yet these same truths may become more and more clear and distinctive by careful study, comparison, analogy, induction, deduction, by considering their relationship to history, the constant development of God's purposes, the continued fulfilment of prophecy, the experience of mankind, and the gathering of the elect.
> p. 154 Vol. 1 Prop. 15 Obs. 1
### Much room for growth
> Here, if anywhere, there is plenty of room for the deepest study, the most guarded discrimination, the keenest perception, the most patient comparison, and the most childlike faith.  Then an increase of knowledge -- as the rich experience of many testifies -- will also come.
> p. 155 Vol. 1 Prop. 15 Obs. 2
### Inexhaustible storehouse
>... the Bible forms “the inexhaustible storehouse” from whence biblical theology derives its solid foundation and growing superstructure—the latter strengthened by the results manifested in historical connection, etc.
>Obs. 3
### Reasons it can become better understood
>Obs. 4. In the Proposition it is purposely said, “can become better understood,” for several reasons: 
>1. (1) There is no subject like this so covered with human additions, speculations, and prejudice. Hence it is so difficult to approach, divested of all bias and preconceived opinions. The greatest care is necessary, owing to the extent and influence of prevailing views, and no step should be taken without substantial scriptural proof to sustain it. 
>2. (2) Conclusions respecting the Kingdom should only be drawn after having traced the subject from the earliest point of its introduction down, through the prophets, to the final testimony of Jesus given by John the Revelator. Multitudes, including most eminent men (as will be shown hereafter), take an isolated passage and, without caring for its connection, build an exclusive theory upon it. 
>3. (3) Covenants, in view of their special importance and fundamental bearing, should have the preference in determining the nature of the Kingdom. This, however, is too much overlooked. 
>4. (4) Some things are underrated, owing to their simplicity (i.e. “too Jewish”): others are rejected because utterly opposed to human expectations (i.e. “How can these things be?”); and others again are declined as utterly unreasonable, not realizing that faith should apprehend them simply because they are recorded in the truthful Word of God (i.e. with all the laudation of faith, there is very little Abrahamic faith in the world). 
>5. (5) The difficulties already enumerated in previous Propositions are not sufficiently considered; difficulties, not relating to the nature of the Kingdom, but to the provisions made for it, the time of its manifestation, the events connected with its exhibition, the symbolical portraiture of its realization, the manner of its divine administration (the divine and human being united), and the remarkable and astounding interpositions of the Supernatural introducing and carrying it forward into the eternal ages—all of which ought to be duly considered in order that increased light may be thrown upon the subject. With such a spirit, and such a posture of recognition and appreciation of the matter before us, there is a prospect before the student of a better understanding of the doctrine.
