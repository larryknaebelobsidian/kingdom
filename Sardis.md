### The Judge
He who has the:
- seven Spirits of God
- seven stars

### The Considerations
Judge knows
- your deeds
- you have a name that you are alive but you are dead
- you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments


I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My God
### Corrective Action
Wake up
Strengthen the things that remain which were about to die
Remember what you have received and heard
Keep it
Repent

### Penalty
If you do not wake up I will come like a thief, you will not know at what hour I will come to you

### Reward
Those who have not soiled their garments
- they will walk with me in white
- they are worthy
He who overcomes
- will be clothed in white garments
- Judge will not erase his name from the book of life
- Judge will confess his name before His Father and His angels

He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
