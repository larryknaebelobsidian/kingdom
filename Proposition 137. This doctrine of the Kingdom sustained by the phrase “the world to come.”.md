# Proposition 137. This doctrine of the Kingdom sustained by the phrase “the world to come.”

>If we find this phrase employed by the Jews to designate a particular period of time, and if it is adopted by the apostles, without the slightest hint as to a change in its meaning, it is fair and just to conclude that in the Apostles’ estimation *it continued to retain the meaning* ascribed to it by the Jews.

### Jewish use of "the world to come"
>Obs. 1. Let us briefly consider in what sense the phrase, “*the world to come*” was used by the Jews. Prof. Bush (Anas. p. 136) says: “‘*The judgment of the great day*,’ the period of ‘*the world to come*,’ is that period which in tie Jewish Christology was *identical with the reigning and judging supremacy of the Messiah*. He quotes Lightfoot in confirmation, and adds from the Sohar, fol. 81, “*In the world to come the holy blessed God will vivify the dead and raise them from their dust*” etc., and then refers to Pococke (*Porta Mosis*, Not. Miscel. p. 166) who says, that R. Saadias maintains that “the resurrection is to take place during the Messiah’s reign on the earth, and so that the promise of the dead Israelites being brought out of their sepulchres is to be accomplished in this world or age, and that we are not to suppose that it pertains to another; consequently the prediction of Daniel respecting the many that sleep in the dust, with various other Scriptures, is to be fulfilled in *the time of salvation*, a phrase entirely *equivalent to the days of the Messiah*. “So it is said in Toreth Adam, fol. 105, that *the day of judgment* will commence, *sub initium dierum resurrectionis*, at the beginning of the days of the resurrection.” (Comp. Prop. 133.) According to Buxtorf, as quoted by Barnes on Heb. 2:5, it was employed by the Jews to denote “the world which is to exist *after* this world is destroyed, and *after* the resurrection of the dead, when souls shall be again united to their bodies,” or “*the days of the Messiah, when He shall reign on the earth*.” The Targum of Palestine (Dr. Etheridge’s Transls.) on Balaam’s prophecy has: “If the house of Israel kill me; with the sword, then, it is made known to me, I shall have *no portion in the world to come*; nevertheless, if I may but die the death of the true! O that my last end may be as the least amon g them.” The student will find additional references to the opinion that “the world to come” referred to the reign of Messiah after the resurrection in Lightfoot’s works, Wetstein, Schoettgen (Bloomfield, Heb. 2:5), Clarke’s, Lange’s, and other Commentaries. See Props. 138 and 139.

>The Talmud frequently speaks of Israelites receiving "a portion of the world to come," "a part in the world to come," and asserts: "He who denies that the Scriptures are from heaven has no part in the world to come," "the generation of the deluge have no part in the world to come," "the generation of the dispersion (at the building of the tower of Babel) have no part in the world to come," "the people of Sodom have no part in the world to come," etc., speaking also of "this world and that to come," etc. Hence Barnes, Com. Heb. 6:5 on the phrase "the world to come," says: "Or, of '*the Coming age*.' '*The age to come*' was a phrase in common use among the Hebrews, to denote the future dispensation, the time of the Messiah," etc. Littel's *Liv. Age*, July 26th, 1879, in an art. on the "Talmud," quotes as follows: R. Simeon on Prov. 6:22 says: "When thou goest, it (the law) shall lead thee, that is, *in this world*. When thou sleepest, it shall keep thee, in the grave, and when thou awakest, it shall talk to thee *in the world to come*." Another utterance on Ps. 23:5 is this given: "In *this world* ye (Israel) offer me (God) the shew-bread and oblations. In *the world to come*, I will spread for you a great table, and *the nations of the world* shall behold and be confounded; for it is said, 'Thou wilt prepare a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.'"

### Expression misinterpreted
>Obs. 2. The effort made by Barnes, Bloomfield, etc., to make this expression used by the Jews, and adopted without dissent or change, in the New Test, to mean *the present* dispensation, age, or world under the Messiah fails, because it does not meet the conditions attached to it in that day, viz., it included *the reign* of the Messiah *after* the resurrection of the dead.

### A dispensation after our present one taught in the Bible
>Obs. 3. The Bible clearly teaches a dispensation to succeed our present one.
>...
>The “harvest” at the end of this age bounds the closing of this and the commencement of the new dispensation. This “harvest” is predicted, as we have shown, Rev. 14:14-20; Joel 3:13, etc., to be Pre-Millennial. The Millennium itself, including the resurrection and events which require the exertion of supernatural power, etc., is indicative of a *new era or age*.

>This is the preparative stage of Redemption; that which follows is Redemption fully realized.

>The proof that Eph. 1:10 thus refers to such a dispensation is found in the context, for 
>1. (1) as numerous passages plainly state, *this gathering of all things into one* is only witnessed when this dispensation or age closes; 
>2. (2) in this gathering “*all things*,” in the Greek the neuter form, evidently also embraces the creation then redeemed from the curse, which only is done in the re-creation *after* this dispensation has ended; 
>3. (3) all things are under Christ in this dispensation mentioned, which is not realized *until after* the Sec. Advent; 
>4. (4) the connection of the “inheritance,” “the redemption of the purchased possession” with this dispensation indicates the same; 
>5. (5) the adopting the exact phraseology of the Jews respecting an incoming age, with the sole change of applying it to Jesus Christ, David’s Son and Lord.
