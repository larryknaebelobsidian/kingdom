>If it can be shown that the apostles and their converts believed in a speedy Advent, that they looked for it near at hand, as immediate and impending sooner or later, then it follows that the Alexandrian modern view of the Kingdom could not have been entertained by them. They then, of necessity, owing to the shortness of time intervening, must have linked the Kingdom they proclaimed with the Sec. Advent (e.g. 2 Tim. 4:1, etc.).

>Every writer of ability and learning -- whatever theory he may adopt respecting the Kingdom -- acknowledges the apostolic and early belief in a speedy Sec. Advent.
>p. 470 Vol. 1 Prop. 74 note

>. . . they *did not regard* the church as the covenanted Kingdom, but as simply *provisionary*.

>The Scriptures abundantly testify to this belief in a *near Advent*, and all of the apostles testify to the same, as e.g. Paul, Rom. 13:11, 12; Phil. 4:5; Heb. 10:25, 36, 37; Tit. 2:13, etc.; James 5:7-9; Peter, 1 Pet. 4:7; John, Apoc. 22:12, 20, etc. The most eminent writers, believers and unbelievers, *candidly acknowledge* this feature, however they may differ in accounting for it.

>Oosterzee (Theol. N. Test., p. 126) says: “*It cannot be denied* that the Lord throughout His teaching, as well as in His last eschatological discourses, represents His coming as very near at hand. This was the natural consequence of the prophetic form of conception, in which the difference of time and space falls into the background, the exhortation to watchfulness and active labor receiving greater force from reference to the near, unexpected, and decisive future.” There is propriety in the reason thus assigned, but it does *not cover* the entire ground, failing to tell us *why* this is the "prophetic form of conception.”
>p. 474-475 Vol. 1 Prop. 74 Obs. 4

>The announcements made of a near Advent in such phrases, “*the Lord is at hand*” “*the coming of the Lord draweth nigh*,” etc., has excited the ridicule of infidels as evidence of grave error; has provoked, in some instances, from professed believers reluctant acknowledgments of “mistakes,” and, in other cases, lamely produced apologies derived from the personal status of the Apostles. The *real ground* for the usage of such language has been too much overlooked. A remarkable feature in this contest over the expressions and meaning of the Apostles is the following: unbelievers and believers both refer to the fact that the language is given in *the old Jewish prophetic form*. The ancient prophets (as e.g. Isa., Joel), spoke of the promised Salvation, the day of the Lord, the Coming of the Mighty One, as being near, close at hand, etc., when the fulfilment of prophecy shows that *centuries upon centuries* must intervene before it is fully realized. No one has *objected to these forms* of prophetic expression, on the ground that they represented remote events as near because it was reasonably supposed that such phraseology was *in strict accordance* with a professed prophetic revelation given in *the largeness of time which must characterize the utterances of the Spirit of God*. *Precisely so* with the Sec. Advent; being a doctrine given by *the selfsame Spirit*, it would *illy correspond* with His *previous utterances* to pronounce it remote, even if many (according to human measure of time) centuries intervened. For the latter, although distant to man, would not be so with God, to whom “*one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day*.” We must, therefore, judge the Apostles’ language, *not by a human, but by the Divine standard*. The Spirit—if of God,—does not measure time as we do; and it *is only fair and honest* to weigh expressions regarding time *given under the direction of that Spirit by the largeness of view* which characterizes God Himself. It the Spirit in the consciousness of Omniscience, Omnipresence, Eternity, the Infinite,—of previously given declarations corresponding to these,—had in the prophetic announcements of the Apostles employed, even to designate thousands of years, the language (to accord with human human ideas) “remote,” far distant,” “long time,” etc., unbelievers would, probably, be *the very first* to point out the *inconsistency* of such phraseology with the Divine attributes, and justly claim that such expressions are *indicative of human infirmity*. We hold, consequently, that the declarations of the Apostles respecting the nearness of the Advent, *are in strict accordance with the truth*, and that, in themselves properly apprehended, they contain *decided evidence* of the Spirit having given them. And, as they sustain an intimate relation to *the perfection* of the Spirit, they cannot be interpreted, without undue violence, as an accommodation to human imperfection.
>p. 475-476 Vol. 1 Prop. 74 Obs. 5

>God's Word is not man's that presents this nearness; hence God, and not man, informs us according to *His own view*, whether it is near or distant. To God it is but a brief period, and this principle relating to time still future is recorded in various Scriptures. Thus e.g. that long (to man) period of Jewish tribulation, extending from the Babylonian Captivity down to Christ, down to our own times, is called in Isa. 54:7, "*a small moment*." This whole dispensation is called "*a day*," etc. Now, the Primitive Church, after the apostles, instead of grasping this Divine mode of speaking, took the language as if characteristic of man's ideas of nearness, and apprehended this nearness as imminent, impending. What possibly increased this feeling in the early churches was the adoption of the defective (Sept.) chronology, by which it was supposed that nearly six thousand years had elapsed, and the Sabbatism was expected (compare candid remarks of Prof. Bush, *On Mill.,* p. 23 and p. 4). But against this, it may be alleged, that the apostles looked for the Advent during their lifetime.  In answer, wee Obs. 8. Two additional points may be suggested: (1) Prophetic time, either as to beginning or ending, or both, is reserved by God as specially pertaining to Himself, and, therefore, any references to such time will be given according *to God's own estimate of time*. (2) The language is also adapted to the capability of salvation. Before the Advent and Kingdom appears, a certain predetermined number of the elect must first be gathered. As the destined seed of Abraham is raised up, the work, which to human estimation is a long one, to God is but a short one, and will be -- to use the Spirit's estimate -- speedily accomplished. Hence we can, and do, receive the comments of unbelievers, etc., excepting their deductions that the apostles were mistaken. This e.g. the author of *The Beginning of Christianity* (p. 366) says in reference to the speedy Advent: "This expectation is expressed by all the apostles in terms which fairly admit of no other interpretation.  It is found in Paul (Rom. 13:11,12; 1 Cor. 7:29-31; and 10:11; Phil. 4:5; 1 Tim. 6:14)." "The same expectation is expressed in the Epistle to the Hebrews (10:25, 37); in the Epistle of James (5:3,8); in the Epistles of Peter (1 Pet. 4:7; 2 Pet. 3:3); in the first Epistle of John (2:18); and in the Apocalypse (1:1; and 2:11; and 22:7,12,20)." To put any other construction on these passages, as if *the parousia* to which they refer was anything else than the Sec. Advent of the Lord to Judgement, would introduce a dangerous license in the interpretation, and one which might be employed to subvert the principle doctrines of the Christian system.  Under the general expectation of the apostles, mistaken though it might prove to be in the one particular of time, there lay a fundamental truth. From our standpoint, the apostles need no apology for employing such language; for its use proves them to have been inspired.
>p. 476-477 Vol. 1 Prop. 74 Obs. 5 note

>In accord with the truthfulness of the Divine statements in reference to time, a decided advantage is derived from them in the form given. The estimate of nearness given by God Himself, in measuring prophetic periods, throws around the Sec. Advent *a purposed indefiniteness*, a sufficiency of uncertainty, an impression that it may be near, to be conducive to watchfulness and piety, to excite vigilance, energy and labor, to impart wisdom, prudence and character, to incite to patient, diligent and faithful study. The evidently designed chasms in chronology, the selection of signs which more or less attend the history of centuries, the concealment of the number of the elect, the withholding the day and the hour, the speaking of things present owing to their certainty of arrival, although still future, the brevity of dispensations when compared with the ages of eternity,—these are all in the same line, suggestive that time is given to present motives of caution and action.
>p. 477 Vol. 1 Prop. 74 Obs. 6

>In view of the inestimable purposes of Salvation connected with the Sec. Advent, the latter cannot be held up *too prominently*, being, as Holy Writ expresses it, “*the blessed hope*.” The nearness connected with the preciousness, makes the Advent so extremely desirable and the object of inspiring hope. Many who receive, and many who reject our doctrinal position, hold to the exceeding worth of this Advent, both to its immanency (may at any time occur), and to its desirableness (i.e. ought to be desired by the true believer).
