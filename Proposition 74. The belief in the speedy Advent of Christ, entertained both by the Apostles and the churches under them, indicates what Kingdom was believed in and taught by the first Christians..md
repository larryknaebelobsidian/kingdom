>If it can be shown that the apostles and their converts believed in a speedy Advent, that they looked for it near at hand, as immediate and impending sooner or later, then it follows that the Alexandrian modern view of the Kingdom could not have been entertained by them. They then, of necessity, owing to the shortness of time intervening, must have linked the Kingdom they proclaimed with the Sec. Advent (e.g. 2 Tim. 4:1, etc.).
> p. 470 Vol. 1 Prop. 74

>Every writer of ability and learning -- whatever theory he may adopt respecting the Kingdom -- acknowledges the apostolic and early belief in a speedy Sec. Advent.
>p. 470 Vol. 1 Prop. 74 note

>. . . they *did not regard* the church as the covenanted Kingdom, but as simply *provisionary*.
>p. 471 Vol. 1 Prop. 74 Obs. 1

>The Scriptures abundantly testify to this belief in a *near Advent*, and all of the apostles testify to the same, as e.g. Paul, Rom. 13:11, 12; Phil. 4:5; Heb. 10:25, 36, 37; Tit. 2:13, etc.; James 5:7-9; Peter, 1 Pet. 4:7; John, Apoc. 22:12, 20, etc. The most eminent writers, believers and unbelievers, *candidly acknowledge* this feature, however they may differ in accounting for it.

Rom. 13:11-12
And _do_ this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed. 12 The night is almost gone, and the day is at hand. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.

Phil. 4:5
Let your considerate _spirit_ be known to all men. The Lord is near[^1].

Heb. 10:25
not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging _one another_, and all the more as you see the day drawing near. [^2]

Heb. 10:36-37
For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise. 37 For yet in a very little while, He who is coming will come, and will not delay.

Tit. 2:13
looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,

James 5:7-9
Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the soil, being patient about it, until it receives the early and late rains. 8 You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand[^3]. 9 Do not groan, brothers, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged. Behold, the Judge is standing right at the door.

1 Peter 4:7
The end of all things is at hand; therefore, be of sound thinking and sober _spirit_ for the purpose of prayer.

Rev. 22:12, 20
12 Behold, I am coming quickly[^rev2212], and My reward _is_ with Me, to render to every man according to his work. 

20 He who bears witness to these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly [^4].” Amen. Come[^17], Lord Jesus.


>The announcements made of a near Advent in such phrases, “*the Lord is at hand*” “*the coming of the Lord draweth nigh*,” etc., has excited the ridicule of infidels as evidence of grave error; has provoked, in some instances, from professed believers reluctant acknowledgments of “mistakes,” and, in other cases, lamely produced apologies derived from the personal status of the Apostles. The *real ground* for the usage of such language has been too much overlooked. A remarkable feature in this contest over the expressions and meaning of the Apostles is the following: unbelievers and believers both refer to the fact that the language is given in *the old Jewish prophetic form*.
