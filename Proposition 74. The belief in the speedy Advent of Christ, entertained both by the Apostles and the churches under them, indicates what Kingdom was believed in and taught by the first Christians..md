>If it can be shown that the apostles and their converts believed in a speedy Advent, that they looked for it near at hand, as immediate and impending sooner or later, then it follows that the Alexandrian modern view of the Kingdom could not have been entertained by them. They then, of necessity, owing to the shortness of time intervening, must have linked the Kingdom they proclaimed with the Sec. Advent (e.g. 2 Tim. 4:1, etc.).

>Every writer of ability and learning -- whatever theory he may adopt respecting the Kingdom -- acknowledges the apostolic and early belief in a speedy Sec. Advent.

>. . . they *did not regard* the church as the covenanted Kingdom, but as simply *provisionary*.
>p. 471 Vol. 1 Prop. 74 Obs. 1

>The Scriptures abundantly testify to this belief in a *near Advent*, and all of the apostles testify to the same, as e.g. Paul, Rom. 13:11, 12; Phil. 4:5; Heb. 10:25, 36, 37; Tit. 2:13, etc.; James 5:7-9; Peter, 1 Pet. 4:7; John, Apoc. 22:12, 20, etc. The most eminent writers, believers and unbelievers, *candidly acknowledge* this feature, however they may differ in accounting for it.

Rom. 13:11-12
And _do_ this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed. 12 The night is almost gone, and the day is at hand. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.

1 Cor. 7:29-31
But this I say, brothers, the time has been shortened, so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none; 30 and those who cry, as though they did not cry; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess; 31 and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it. For the form of this world is passing away.

not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging _one another_, and all the more as you see the day drawing near. [^2]

looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,

Your gold and your silver have rusted, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up _such_ treasure in the last days!

James 5:7-9
Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the soil, being patient about it, until it receives the early and late rains. 8 You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand[^3]. 9 Do not groan, brothers, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged. Behold, the Judge is standing right at the door.

1 Peter 4:7
The end of all things is at hand; therefore, be of sound thinking and sober _spirit_ for the purpose of prayer.

Rev. 1:1
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His slaves the things which must soon happen; and He indicated _this_ by sending _it_ through His angel to His slave John,

Rev. 2:11
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will never be hurt by the second death.’

Rev. 22:7
Let the one who does unrighteousness, still do unrighteousness; and the one who is filthy, still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous, still do righteousness; and the one who is holy, still keep himself holy.”

Rev. 22:20
20 He who bears witness to these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly [^4].” Amen. Come[^17], Lord Jesus.


>The announcements[^3] made of a near Advent[^4] in such phrases, “*the Lord is at hand*” “*the coming of the Lord draweth nigh*,” etc., has excited the ridicule of infidels as evidence of grave error; has provoked, in some instances, from professed believers reluctant acknowledgments of “mistakes,” and, in other cases, lamely produced apologies derived from the personal status of the Apostles. The *real ground* for the usage of such language has been too much overlooked. A remarkable feature in this contest over the expressions and meaning of the Apostles is the following: unbelievers and believers both refer to the fact that the language is given in *the old Jewish prophetic form*.
