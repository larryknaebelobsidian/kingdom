#sevenchurches 

### The Judge
I - the one who 
- holds the seven stars in His right hand
- walks among the seven golden lampstands

### Considerations
I know
- your deeds
- your toil
- your perseverance
	- for My name's sake
	- have not grown weary
Yet you do have
- you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans
	- which I also hate
### Judgement
I have this against you
- you have left your first love
### Corrective Action
Remember
- From where you have fallen
Repent
Do the deeds you did at first
### Penalty
Or else
- I am coming to you
- will remove your lampstand out of its place

***To him who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirt says to the churches***
### Reward
To him who overcomes
- I will grant to eat of the tree of life (which is in the Paradise of God)
