#sevenchurches 

I - the one who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands
I know
- your deeds
- your toil
- your perseverence
	- for My name's sake
	- have not grown weary

I have this against you
- you have left your first love

Remember
Repent
Do the deeds you did at first

Or else
- I am coming to you
- will remove your lampstand out of its place

Yet
- you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans
	- which I also hate

To him who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirt says to the churches

To him who overcomes
- I will grant to eat of the tree of life (which is in the Paradise of God)
