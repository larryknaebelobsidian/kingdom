>. . . a progress of apprehension by man . . . no advance in Divine teaching after the apostolic age was ever admitted by the Church, and that all elucidations, renewed definitions, etc., indicative of a clearer apprehension of the truth, are invariably based upon, and derived from, *the original truth* in the Old and New Testaments.

> Prayerful study of the Scriptures will evidence itself, *not in profession, but in fruits.
> p. 117 Vol. 1 Prop. 9 Obs. 5

> . . . if a man expects "direct spiritual illumination" or an "intellectual light" by which he can know the truth without an acceptance and patient study *of that* which the Spirit has *already* given, he only shows that he is self-deceived. Prayer and the Spirit indeed are of great avail in their moral bearing, in preparing us for the perception and reception of the truth, but they are not given *to supersede* the searching of the Scriptures (John 5:39), the reasoning out of the Scriptures (Acts 17:2; 18:4, etc.), the using of our faculties in noting the oracles of God (Heb. 5:14), the taking heed unto the Word given (2 Pet. 1:19), the daily receiving and study of Holy Writ (Acts 17:11).
