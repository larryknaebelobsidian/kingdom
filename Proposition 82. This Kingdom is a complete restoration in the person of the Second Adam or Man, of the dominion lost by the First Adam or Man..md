# Proposition 82. This Kingdom is a complete restoration in the person of the Second Adam or Man, of the dominion lost by the First Adam or Man.
### Announced by Psalmist and Paul
>Obs. 1. What the dominion forfeited by sin was to be, is clearly announced, e.g. by the Psalmist and Paul.
>...
>Heb. 2:6,7
>Ps. 8:5-8
### Some confine it to Jesus Divine Sovereignty
>Obs. 2. In the next place, all Christian writers on the subject inform us that this dominion is restored to man again through Jesus Christ, the second Adam. But, with the exception of Millenarian writers, they somehow confine it to Jesus in His Divine Sovereignty,
>...
>Such spiritualize the dominion, and do not allow its ultimate realization in the very place where it was forfeited, i.e. they refuse to believe in man’s restored dominion over the earth, and make thus an imperfect Redemption.
### Restored Theocratic David throne and Kingdom
>Obs. 3. This dominion, here on earth, will be exerted by Jesus, the Man, through the re-establishment of the Theocratic ordering. It is the restored Theocratic Davidic throne and Kingdom, in its organized and associated capacity, under the leadership of the covenanted King that constitutes the leverage for the exertion of this dominion. The saints, made like unto Christ and associated with Him in His power, largely participate in it, all nature being brought into subjection to them. Thus the Scriptures will be amply fulfilled.
### In abeyance until the kingdom
>Obs. 4. Hence, while this dominion is even now lodged in the Son of Man, yet it is held in abeyance until the period of its manifestation in and through this Kingdom.
>...
>it is erroneous (as a multitude of writers, including Hodge, Barnes, etc., just quoted), to say that this dominion was fully attained and realized by the incarnation and the exaltation of the Son of God.
>...
>we see not yet all things put under Him, and He is awaiting the time when His enemies shall be made His footstool But the period of time is coming when this will be done, and the dominion, held in restraint for purposes of mercy and love, will be exhibited with God-like power and glory.
### The Son of Man must come first
>Obs. 5. It is only in the Millennial age, when this Theocratic Kingdom is established, that this forfeited dominion is fully restored.
>...
>Hence this era must be preceded by the Coming of “the Son of Man” (Prop. 119-121).
### Perfected Salvation
>Obs. 6. If such an external, outward dominion is lacking in the history of the earth, then an important restitution is wanting, and we receive an imperfect Redemption; with its restoration we obtain an important element of perfected Salvation.
### Man's noble origin and high destiny
>Obs. 7. This dominion, promised, predicted and restored, is corroborative of the Biblical account of man’s noble origin and high destiny, forming quite a contrast to the ignoble theories of recent scientists.
