>the doctrine was in the first churches, viz.: a belief that in the millennial age, still future, Christ would personally come and reign, restoring the Davidic throne and Kingdom and fulfilling the covenant promises,

>It was only when the Scriptures and the promises were spiritualized, when, under the influence of release from persecution and incoming churchly prosperity, the church itself was exalted through civil patronage, that the Primitive doctrine was gradually but surely set aside, and the church itself was made (as by Origen) “the mystic Kingdom of heaven,” or (as by Eusebius) “the very image of the Kingdom of Christ,” or (as by Augustine) “the City of God.”

>Obs. 2. The Ency. Amer., Art. “Mill.,” briefly states the case: “The Gnostics, despising matter, were adversaries to the dogma of the Millennium. . . . And ultimately the philosophical school of Alexandria.”

>“in this century the Millenarian doctrine fell into disrepute, through the influence especially of Origen, who strenuously opposed it, because it contravened some of his opinions.”
>Obs. 2

>In his Com. of the First Three Cen. (vol. 2, see. 38), he observes: “Among the Jewish opinions to which in this age philosophy proved detrimental, the most distinguished was that of the reign of Christ a thousand years, with the saints restored to their bodies. This opinion, I believe, was introduced into the church near the commencement of the Christian commonwealth. And down to the times of Origen, all the teachers who were so disposed openly professed and taught it, although there were some who either denied it, or at least called it into question. But Origen assailed it fiercely; for it was repugnant to his philosophy; and by the system of biblical interpretation which he discovered, he gave a different turn to those texts of Scripture on which the patrons of this doctrine most relied.” “It is certain, from Justin Martyr and others, that very many, and they men of great influence, thought as he did (i.e. were Millenariaus), nor were they on that account taxed with corrupt doctrine.” “But in the third century the reputation of this doctrine declined; and first in Egypt, through the influence especially of Origen. . . . And yet it could not be exterminated in a moment; it still had respectable advocates.”
>Obs. 2

>“He (Origen) wished to have the literal and obvious sense of the words disregarded, and an arcane sense, lying concealed in the envelope of the words, to be sought for. But the advocates of an earthly Kingdom of Christ rested their cause solely on the natural and proper sense of certain expressions in the Bible.”
>Obs. 2

>To reconcile these opposite tendencies, another and succeeding party arose, who assumed that reason occupied the position of umpire, and from the deductions of reason instituted a medium between the two, retaining something from both Gnosticism and Chiliasm, so- far as interpretation was concerned, but also spiritualizing the Kingdom, applying it to the church, etc. From this arose the rejection of the peculiar and distinguishing characteristics belonging to both Chiliasm and Gnosticism. Hence, it was the relationship that error sustained to Christianity—adopting the phraseology of the latter but with other meanings attached, wearing the garb of friendship and even of piety—that gradually undermined the formerly received doctrine of the covenanted Kingdom.
>Obs. 3

>Obs. 4. It is well to keep in view the direct means employed to get rid of the Chiliastic idea of the Kingdom. 
>1. (1) Caius (or Gaius) and Dionysins first cast doubt upon the genuineness and inspiration of the Apocalypse, it evidently being supposed that the appeals made to it—in view of its correspondence with preceding Jewish ideas—could not otherwise be set aside. 
>2. (2) By rejecting the literal sense, and substituting a figurative or allegorical; this effectually modified covenant and prophecy. 
>3. (3) Such portions of the Old Test, as literally taught the doctrine, had their prophetic inspiration discredited, as in the Clementines (comp. Neander on them). 
>4. (4) Accepting all the prophetical portions, and what could not be conveniently allegorized and applied to the church, was attributed to heaven for fulfilment (as seen in Origen and his followers). 
>5. (5) Making promises directly given to the Jewish nation as such, either conditional in their nature or else merely typical of the blessings accruing to Gentiles. These, after what has been written, need no comment.
>Obs. 4 reformatted

>Obs. 5. Another deadly, most effective weapon was the philosophy of that period.
>. . .
>The first insidious approach was, that this “wall and hedge” was so ran as to exclude from the vineyard of truth whatever human reason regarded as objectionable; the second followed as a necessary (through human infirmity and shortsightedness) result, error itself was graciously accepted, diligently planted, cultivated, and grown. The crop was abundant.
>Obs. 5


>repetition alone is often the parent of faith, and then of authority,
>Obs. 5

>Obs. 7. Another cause which operated largely to diminish the belief in the doctrine of the Kingdom was the coldness and enmity which arose between the Jewish and Gentile Christians, when they separated into parties antagonistic to each other.
>. . .
>Nothing contributed so largely to this as the removal (through Gnostic and Alexandrian influence) of the distinctive Jewish idea of the Messiahship and resultant Kingdom, the bond of faith that had united Jew and Gentile into fraternal believers.


>Obs. 8. Notably, the conversion of Constantine, the deliverance and exaltation of the church, and finally the union of State and church under Imperial supervision and protection, served to make Millenarianism unpalatable.

>the Christians, emancipated from oppression and persecution, and dominant and prosperous in their turn, began to lose their vivid expectation of our Lord’s speedy Advent and their spiritual conception of His Kingdom, and to look upon the temporal supremacy of Christianity as a fulfilment of the promised reign of Christ on earth. The Roman Empire, become Christian, was regarded no longer an object of prophetic denunciation, but as the scene of a Millennial development. This view, however, was soon met by the figurative interpretation of the Millennium, as the reign of Christ in the hearts of all true believers.”
>Obs. 8

>The church now prepared for a long-continued period of temporal prosperity, and the State church of that time forgot the Millennial glory of the future.”
>Obs. 8


>Obs. 9. Another method, pointed out by Brooks, Mede, etc., which materially aided in removing our doctrine, was the suppressing of Millenarian works. Thus e.g. the works of Papias, several from the pen of Irenaeus, the Treatise of Nepos against the Allegorizers, Tertullian’s on Paradise, and others, were successfully removed. Indeed the writings of some of the Fathers were so totally obliterated that it is only by intimations in the writings of opposers that we know that they were Chiliastic in sentiment. While the ravages and changes of time, the destructiveness incident to age, may account for the removal of some, yet the extent of the suppression (together with corruptions, omissions, substitutions of other writings) clearly indicates the animus of aversion and hostility.

>Probably no work has appeared that had such a powerful influence in overwhelming the more ancient doctrine, as Augustine’s leading one, The City of God. This was specially designed to teach the existence of the Kingdom of God in the church beside or contemporaneous with the earthly or human Kingdom.

>Obs. 12. The cessation, in almost a total manner, of the conversion of the Jews, also materially aided in extinguishing the doctrine of the Kingdom.

>many writers have shown that the Chiliasts, more or less, down to Constantine’s conversion thought that Home would be the seat of the Antichrist and the Roman power would be destroyed. This was widely circulated, and finally became a part of the Chiliastic creed, impressed by persecution and the hope of deliverance, and was so regarded by its opponents. Now the prophecy as believed, instead of being verified, seemed to be utterly vain and idle when the Empire became professedly Christian. The result was, that the failure of a portion of the Chiliastic scheme, as then entertained, was deemed, without examination, to be sufficient proof of the unsoundness of every other part, and the whole was rejected.
>Obs. 15


>Obs. 16. The opposition that Chiliasts maintained against various errors and the allegorical interpretation of Scripture, excited hostility against them, and contributed to aid in the suppression of the doctrine.
