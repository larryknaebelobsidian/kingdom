# Proposition 76. The doctrine of the Kingdom was changed under the Gnostic and Alexandrian influence.

>... the doctrine was in the first churches, viz.: a belief that in the millennial age, still future, Christ would personally come and reign, restoring the Davidic throne and Kingdom and fulfilling the covenant promises,
>p. 499 Vol. 1 Prop. 76
### Influence of churchly prosperity and spiritualization of Scriptures
>It was only *when* the Scriptures and the promises were spiritualized, *when*, under the influence of release from persecution and incoming churchly prosperity, the church itself was exalted through civil patronage, that the Primitive doctrine was gradually but surely set aside, and *the church itself* was made (as by Origen) “*the mystic Kingdom of heaven*,” or (as by Eusebius) “*the very image* of the Kingdom of Christ,” or (as by Augustine) “*the City of God*.”
>p. 499 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 1
### Destructive influence of Alexandrian school, Gnosticism and Origin
>Obs. 2. *The Ency. Amer.*, Art. “Mill.,” briefly states the case: “The *Gnostics*, despising matter, were *adversaries* to the dogma of the Millennium. . . . And ultimately the philosophical school of Alexandria.”
>p. 500 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 2

>“in this century the Millenarian doctrine fell into disrepute, *through the influence especially of Origen*, who strenuously opposed it, because *it contravened* some of his opinions.”
>p. 500 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 2

>In his *Com. of the First Three Cen.* (vol. 2, see. 38), he observes: “Among *the Jewish opinions* to which in this age *philosophy* proved detrimental, *the most distinguished* was that of the reign of Christ a thousand years, with the saints restored to their bodies. This opinion, I believe, was introduced into the church near the commencement of the Christian commonwealth. *And down to the times of Origen*, all the teachers who were so disposed openly professed and taught it, although there were some who either denied it, or at least called it into question. But *Origen assailed it fiercely; for it was repugnant to his philosophy*; and by the system of biblical interpretation which he discovered, he gave *a different turn* to those texts of Scripture on which the patrons of this doctrine most relied.” 
>"It *is certain* that in the second century, the opinion that Christ would reign a thousand years on the earth, was diffused *over a great part of Christendom, and that the most eminent doctors favored it; and no controversy with them was moved by those who thought otherwise.* Tertullian speaks of it as *the common doctrine of the whole church.* “It is *certain*, from Justin Martyr and others, that *very many, and they men of great influence*, thought as he did (i.e. were Millenariaus), nor were they on that account taxed with corrupt doctrine.” “But in the third century the reputation of this doctrine declined; and first in Egypt, through the influence especially of Origen. . . . And yet it could not be exterminated in a moment; it still had respectable advocates.”
>--Mosheim
>p. 500 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 2

>“He (Origen) wished to have the literal and obvious sense of the words disregarded, and *an arcane sense*, lying concealed in the envelope of the words, to be sought for. But the advocates of an earthly Kingdom of Christ rested their cause solely on *the natural and proper sense* of certain expressions in the Bible.”
>p. 500 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 2
### The mixture producing decline
>To reconcile these opposite tendencies, another and succeeding party arose, who assumed that reason occupied the position of umpire, and from the deductions of reason instituted a medium between the two, retaining something from both Gnosticism and Chiliasm, so far as interpretation was concerned, but *also spiritualizing the Kingdom*, applying it to the church, etc. From this arose the rejection of the peculiar and distinguishing characteristics belonging to both Chiliasm and Gnosticism. Hence, it was the relationship that error sustained to Christianity—adopting the phraseology of the latter but with other meanings attached, wearing the garb of friendship and even of piety—that gradually undermined *the formerly received doctrine* of the covenanted Kingdom.
>p. 501 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 3
### Direct means to get rid of the Chiliastic idea 
>Obs. 4. It is well to keep in view the direct means employed *to get rid* of the Chiliastic idea of the Kingdom. 
>1. (1) Caius (or Gaius) and Dionysins first cast doubt upon the genuineness and inspiration of the Apocalypse, it evidently being supposed that the appeals made to it—in view of its correspondence with preceding Jewish ideas—*could not otherwise* be set aside. 
>2. (2) By rejecting the literal sense, and substituting a figurative or allegorical; this *effectually* modified covenant and prophecy. 
>3. (3) Such portions of the Old Test, as literally taught the doctrine, had their prophetic inspiration discredited, as in the Clementines (comp. Neander on them). 
>4. (4) Accepting all the prophetical portions, and what could not be conveniently allegorized and applied to the church, was attributed to heaven for fulfilment (as seen in Origen and his followers). 
>5. (5) Making promises directly given to the Jewish nation as such, either conditional in their nature or else merely typical of the blessings accruing to Gentiles. These, after what has been written, need no comment.
>p. 502 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 4 reformatted
### The weapon of philosophy
>Obs. 5. Another deadly, most effective weapon was *the philosophy* of that period.
>. . .
>The first insidious approach was, that this “wall and hedge” was so ran as to exclude from the vineyard of truth whatever human reason regarded as objectionable; the second followed as a necessary (through human infirmity and shortsightedness) result, error itself was graciously accepted, diligently planted, cultivated, and grown. The crop was abundant.
>p. 502 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 5

>... repetition alone is often the parent of faith, and then of authority,...
>p. 503 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 6
### Influence of the enmity between Jewish and Gentile Christians
>Obs. 7. Another cause which operated largely to diminish the belief in the doctrine of the Kingdom was *the coldness and enmity* which arose between the Jewish and Gentile Christians, when they separated into parties antagonistic to each other.
>. . .
>Nothing contributed so largely to this as the removal (through Gnostic and Alexandrian influence) of *the distinctive Jewish* idea of the Messiahship and resultant Kingdom, *the bond of faith* that had united Jew and Gentile into fraternal believers.
>p. 504 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 7
### Constantine and the Christian state
>Obs. 8. Notably, the conversion of Constantine, the deliverance and exaltation of the church, and finally the union of State and church under Imperial supervision and protection, *served* to make Millenarianism *unpalatable*.
>p. 505 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 8

>... the Christians, emancipated from oppression and persecution, and dominant and prosperous in their turn, *began to lose their vivid expectation* of our Lord’s speedy Advent and their spiritual conception of His Kingdom, and to look upon *the temporal supremacy* of Christianity *as a fulfilment* of the promised reign of Christ on earth. The Roman Empire, become Christian, was regarded no longer an object of prophetic denunciation, but as the scene *of a Millennial* development. This view, however, was soon met by *the figurative* interpretation of the Millennium, as the reign of Christ *in the hearts* of all true believers.”
>p. 505 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 8

>The church now prepared for a long-continued period of temporal prosperity, and *the State church of that time forgot the Millennial glory of the future*.”
>p. 505 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 8
### Suppression of Millenarian works
>Obs. 9. Another method, pointed out by Brooks, Mede, etc., which materially aided in removing our doctrine, was *the suppressing* of Millenarian works. Thus e.g. the works of Papias, several from the pen of Irenaeus, the Treatise of Nepos against the Allegorizers, Tertullian’s on Paradise, and others, were successfully removed. Indeed the writings of some of the Fathers were so totally obliterated that it is only by intimations in the writings of opposers that we know that they were Chiliastic in sentiment. While the ravages and changes of time, the destructiveness incident to age, may account for the removal of some, yet *the extent* of the suppression (together with corruptions, omissions, substitutions of other writings) clearly indicates *the animus* of aversion and hostility.
>p. 506 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 9
### Writers who opposed
p. 506-507 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 10
### Great opposers - Augustine, The City of God
>Probably no work has appeared that had such a powerful influence in overwhelming the more ancient doctrine, as Augustine’s leading one, *The City of God*. This was specially designed to teach *the existence of the Kingdom of God in the church* beside or contemporaneous with the earthly or human Kingdom.
>p. 508 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 11
### Cessation of the conversion of the Jews
>Obs. 12. The cessation, in almost a total manner, of the conversion of the Jews, also materially aided in extinguishing the doctrine of the Kingdom.
>p. 509 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 12
### Falsely accuse Pauline, Petrine, Johannine theologies
>Obs. 13. This enables us to dispose of the historical inaccuracy of those who, overlooking the causes of decline mentioned, tell us that the decrease of Chiliasm is due to the influence of the Pauline Theology superseding the Petrine or Johannine; Learned disquisitions, abounding *with mere assertion*, are given on this point; but to sustain this philosophical conceit, it is requisite to close the eyes to well-known facts that utterly disprove the theory. It is a cleverly contrived plan to throw, if possible, *an apostolic mantle* over a later broached theory of the Kingdom.
>p. 510 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 13
### Influence of unsound interpretations
>... many writers have shown that the Chiliasts, more or less, down to Constantine’s conversion thought that Rome would be the seat of the Antichrist and the Roman power would be destroyed. This was widely circulated, and finally became a part of the Chiliastic creed, impressed by persecution and the hope of deliverance, and was so regarded by its opponents. Now the prophecy as believed, instead of being verified, seemed to be utterly vain and idle *when* the Empire became professedly Christian. The result was, that the failure of a portion of the Chiliastic scheme, as *then* entertained, was deemed, without examination, to be *sufficient* proof of the unsoundness of every other part, and the whole was rejected.
>p. 511 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 15
### Excited hostility contributed to the suppression of Chiliasm
>Obs. 16. The opposition that Chiliasts maintained against various errors and the allegorical interpretation of Scripture, excited hostility against them, and contributed to aid in the suppression of the doctrine.
>p. 511 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 16
