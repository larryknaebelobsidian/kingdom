>the doctrine was in the first churches, viz.: a belief that in the millennial age, still future, Christ would personally come and reign, restoring the Davidic throne and Kingdom and fulfilling the covenant promises,

>It was only when the Scriptures and the promises were spiritualized, when, under the influence of release from persecution and incoming churchly prosperity, the church itself was exalted through civil patronage, that the Primitive doctrine was gradually but surely set aside, and the church itself was made (as by Origen) “the mystic Kingdom of heaven,” or (as by Eusebius) “the very image of the Kingdom of Christ,” or (as by Augustine) “the City of God.”

>Obs. 2. The Ency. Amer., Art. “Mill.,” briefly states the case: “The Gnostics, despising matter, were adversaries to the dogma of the Millennium. . . . And ultimately the philosophical school of Alexandria.”

>“in this century the Millenarian doctrine fell into disrepute, through the influence especially of Origen, who strenuously opposed it, because it contravened some of his opinions.”
>Obs. 2

>In his Com. of the First Three Cen. (vol. 2, see. 38), he observes: “Among the Jewish opinions to which in this age philosophy proved detrimental, the most distinguished was that of the reign of Christ a thousand years, with the saints restored to their bodies. This opinion, I believe, was introduced into the church near the commencement of the Christian commonwealth. And down to the times of Origen, all the teachers who were so disposed openly professed and taught it, although there were some who either denied it, or at least called it into question. But Origen assailed it fiercely; for it was repugnant to his philosophy; and by the system of biblical interpretation which he discovered, he gave a different turn to those texts of Scripture on which the patrons of this doctrine most relied.” “It is certain, from Justin Martyr and others, that very many, and they men of great influence, thought as he did (i.e. were Millenariaus), nor were they on that account taxed with corrupt doctrine.” “But in the third century the reputation of this doctrine declined; and first in Egypt, through the influence especially of Origen. . . . And yet it could not be exterminated in a moment; it still had respectable advocates.”
>Obs. 2

>“He (Origen) wished to have the literal and obvious sense of the words disregarded, and an arcane sense, lying concealed in the envelope of the words, to be sought for. But the advocates of an earthly Kingdom of Christ rested their cause solely on the natural and proper sense of certain expressions in the Bible.”
>Obs. 2

>To reconcile these opposite tendencies, another and succeeding party arose, who assumed that reason occupied the position of umpire, and from the deductions of reason instituted a medium between the two, retaining something from both Gnosticism and Chiliasm, so- far as interpretation was concerned, but also spiritualizing the Kingdom, applying it to the church, etc. From this arose the rejection of the peculiar and distinguishing characteristics belonging to both Chiliasm and Gnosticism. Hence, it was the relationship that error sustained to Christianity—adopting the phraseology of the latter but with other meanings attached, wearing the garb of friendship and even of piety—that gradually undermined the formerly received doctrine of the covenanted Kingdom.
>Obs. 3
