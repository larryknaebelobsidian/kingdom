<p>Matt. 25:34 “Then the King will say to those on His right, ’Come, you
who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom, which has been
prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>John 17:24 Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me,
be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have
given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>Eph. 1:4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the
world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him in love,</p>
<p>Heb. 4:3 For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has
said, “As I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter My rest,” although
His works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>1 Pet. 1:20 He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but
appeared in these last times for the sake of you</p>
<p>Rev. 13:8 And all who dwell on the earth will worship him,
<em>everyone</em> whose name has not been written from the foundation of
the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comp. Matt. 13:35, Luke 11:50, Rev 17:8 p. 34 Vol. 1 Prop. 2 note</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matt. 13:35 so that what was spoken through the prophet might be
fulfilled, saying, “I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter
things hidden since the foundation of the world.”</p>
<p>Luke 11:50 so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the
foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,</p>
<p>Rev. 17:8 “The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to
come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on
the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the
foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he
was and is not and will come.</p>

<p>the contemplated final use of this world was allied with its origin.

<h3 id="comprehended-in-the-eternal-counsels">Comprehended in the
eternal counsels</h3>
<p>Obs. 1 &gt; Hence, we properly infer <em>the dignity</em> of this
subject, comprehended in the eternal counsels and evolved from the
ever-existing “purpose of Him, which worketh all things after the
counsel of His own will.” &gt; p. 34 Vol. 1 Prop. 2 Obs. 1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>King Edward VI.’s Catechism (Bickersteth’s <em>Promised Glory</em>,
p. 2), however it may explain it, correctly affirms : “Before the Lord
God made heaven and earth, He determined to have for Himself a most
beautiful kingdom and holy commonwealth.” p. 34 Vol. 1 Prop. 2 Obs. 1
note ### Demonstrates Divine plan and unity of design Obs. 2 We also
justly infer, that God’s will thus expressed respecting the kingdom
indicates <em>a Divine plan</em>, which, in view of His attributes,
necessarily embraces <em>unity of design</em>. p. 34 Vol. 1 Prop 2 Obs.
2 ### Identified with eternal purpose and creation Obs. 3 p. 34 Vol. 1
Prop 2 Obs. 3 ### Divine determination notwithstanding the fall Obs. 4.
The exercise of creative power, and its continued exhibition in behalf
of man and the world, clearly shows <em>the Divine determination</em> to
establish this kingdom, notwithstanding the antagonistic elements
introduced by the fall. All things exist, because God has a determined
end in view, which end is embraced in this kingdom. p. 35 Vol. 1 Prop 2
Obs. 4 ### Foundation of earth laid in preparation for this kingdom Obs.
5. This kingdom is one pertaining to the earth. Before the creation of
the world, it only existed in the determination or purpose of God, but
at creation the very foundation of the world was laid in preparation for
it. … “From the foundation of the world” is indicative that God purposed
this very earth, when founded, for this kingdom. p. 35 Vol. 1 Prop 2

<p>Obs. 14. Lastly, this proposition is based on the scripturally
derived statement, that a Divine Creating Mind and a Ruling Will orders
and rules over all, so that notwithstanding apparent difficulties and
unexplained problems, that Mind and Will shall be ultimately
triumphantly vindicated in an open, revealed manner, indicating, what
piety already realizes as an earnest in preparatory work, their close
and intimate relationship with man and earth. p. 37 Vol. 1 Prop 2 Obs.
