>Obs. 1. As stated in preceding Proposition, the language of Peter was in accordance with the views of the Jews.

>The proof is, that all the Jewish converts and churches, as far as we know, never supposed that this passage controverted such an opinion. Instead of being a stumbling-block in the way, this passage was thought to be confirmatory of their belief of the dreadful fire which should devour the adversaries (Dan. 7:10, 11, “fiery stream,” “the burning flame”), when the Messiah would come.

>Obs. 2. The early Church, receiving its teaching direct from inspired teachers (and appealing to them, as Papias, Justin, Irenaeus), found no such limitation as was afterward engrafted upon Peter’s language.

>One and all held to .the fulfilment of the covenant and the prophecies based upon it as succeeding this conflagration: This is clearly announced in their writings.

>Obs. 3. It is noticeable that no Millenarian author has taken advantage of the doubts cast upon the canonical authority,of the Second Epistle.

>Obs. 5. Peter’s representation of the Kingdom, as given in his own writings, would be vitiated, if we accept of the extravagant estimates made concerning the extent of this fire.

>Obs. 7. As just intimated, any view of Peter’s statement which makes an imperfect Redemption, in not restoring the earth, the animate creation, and the race of man to their forfeited position, ought at once to be rejected as inconsistent with the Divine Purpose respecting Redemption as given in covenant and promise, and with the perfection, honor, and glory of the Redeemer (Prop. 140, Obs. 7). To make this earth, animated creation, and the race of man, as such, all to be destroyed, rooted out of existence, or (as a climax) to have it all one mass of fire, perpetuated in this state to constitute (so Pres. Edwards’ His. Redemp., p. 421) an eternal hell (!) for sinners and devils—this is to make Redemption incomplete, to keep this earth forever under the curse, to restore only a few of the forfeited blessings, and to diminish, with fearful rigor, some of the most comprehensively precious promises that the Bible contains. Strange indeed that men should allow one passage to crush the hope engendered in a groaning creation, in a sin-cursed earth, in the longings of nations, and to limit the rich and full restitution of all things and the expressed ability and willingness of the Mighty King to perform it. The early Church could not be so illogical.

>Obs. 9. The time of this fire is the time when “the harvest of the earth” is gathered and the tares (Matt. 13:30, 39, 40) shall be “burned in the fire” (as “the ungodly men” mentioned by Peter), but this harvest (Rev. 14:14-20) occurs under the seventh trumpet preceding the Millennial age. When this conflagration takes place it is associated with the resurrection of the saints, for Peter encourages believers to expect a glorious deliverance at that period; this accurately corresponds with the resurrection (Rev. 11:15-18) and rewarding of the saints under the last trumpet when “the sovereignty of this world” shall be wielded by Christ. The mention of “the Day of Judgment” (comp. Props. 133 and 134) with a knowledge of the Jewish and Scriptural method of speaking of that day, viz., to be followed by Messiah’s Kingdom here on earth as the Millennial prophecies declare;

#### Universal burning of all things but new creation out of left-overs (post-Millennial)
#### Universal burning but pre-Millennial

>These three classes, by the extent of the fire advocated, make no provision for the Kingdom to exist in its expressed covenanted terms, and none for the deliverance of inanimate and animate creation, having the same destroyed and an entire new creation erected from the ashes, etc. Instead of the curse being removed from the existing world, the world falls beneath the curse and is sacrificed, so that an entire new one which has never borne a curse may be created.

## 2 Peter 3:5-13
For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God _the_ heavens existed long ago and _the_ earth was formed out of water and by water, 
6 through which the world at that time was destroyed, being deluged with water. 
7 But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. 
8 But do not let this one _fact_ escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. 
9 The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some consider slowness, but is patient toward you, not willing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance. 
10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be found _out_. 
11 Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, 
12 looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens burning will be destroyed, and the elements will melt with intense heat! 
13 But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
