# Proposition 165. The doctrine of this Kingdom enables us to form a correct estimate of human governments.

>Obs. 1. In the consideration of this subject men have been apt to rush to extremes, presenting conclusions which are not warranted by Scripture.

>Obs. 2. This doctrine enables us to detect the fallacy in the writings of some devoted men (Fulton, etc.) when they assume the existence of Christ’s kingdom as already established, believers being its subjects, etc., and then reason from this assumption that believers being already the subjects of an instituted kingdom, they must stand aloof from all human government.
>...
>the believer is directed to conform to the present arrangement of things, without sacrificing his Christian principle or violating the commands of God, until the time that the King Himself comes. This is done too by way of trial and to prepare him, as well as the race, to appreciate more fully the Divine government of the Messiah when manifested. Man, as a punishment and a test, is left to work out his ideas of government practically in order, as the end will prove, that depravity in the highest exhibition of man’s relations (i.e. in the civil) will gain the ascendency, and that human nature in the muss, when prosperity or greatness is attained, cannot withstand corruption.
>...
>believers are exhorted to hold themselves in patience, and to anticipate for the future an increased wickedness, which will be severely afflictive to them; to discharge their duties as far as possible and to suffer, if needs be, for the sake of the truth.

>Therefore, at present, we indorse Luther’s position (Kurtz, Ch. His.) “that the Gospel secured spiritual liberty, but did not subvert civil government and social institutions,” but enables us under such government to exemplify Christian character.
>Obs. 2

>Obs. 3. This estimate and end of human government not only enables us to discard the Utopian notion of its development into a state of Perfectibility, but the attempted union of Church and State during the “Times of the Gentiles.”

>Obs. 4. The student, in corroboration of our position, will observe a singular feature, viz., that although the Roman Empire (and its divisions) has loudly proclaimed its profession of religion, appealed in laudation to its conversion under Constantine, praised itself as “most Christian,” and even pronounced itself as a “Holy Empire,” yet God, in view of no radical change, takes no notice whatever of all this boasted profession, and by this very significant silence (excepting in Rev. where the Empire is still recognized to be, as in Daniel, a “beast”) places over against the extravagant eulogies of men His own estimate of such conversion and profession.

>Obs. 5. It is a fact, as various able writers on the laws of the Theocracy have shown, that the nearer governments adopt, and carry out, the great principles underlying the Theocracy, the purer and more elevated is the civil polity, and the greater strength, security and happiness is imparted to all classes, rulers and ruled.

>the reader will not fail to notice that a mistake—serious—is made by supposing, that the Theocracy is merely given as a pattern—an enunciation of principles—for other governments to follow because it is to be superseded by others, instead of its being, as the Bible plainly predicts, for a time held in abeyance, owing to depravity, until the proper material is gathered out for its overwhelming inauguration.
