# Proposition 138. This doctrine of the Kingdom fully corroborated by “the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.”

>This Kingdom is after the Sec. Advent, and in a period, dispensation, age, day, or time, which, owing to the public, personal manifestation of Jesus Christ, is by way of pre-eminence entitled “His day;” etc. Now, if it can be shown that the Jews believed that the day or age of the Messiah was thus identified with the period of the reign of the Messiah on David’s throne, and that the Apostles, without any change or transformation, apply this phraseology to Jesus after His Sec. Advent, it at once powerfully confirms our doctrine of the Kingdom. For, if our interpretation of the Covenant and promises is correct, then such a day or time of Christ must be still future.
### The Jewish view
>Obs. 1. The Jewish view is given by many writers.

>How later Jews continued to hold this notion of the day thus linked with these adjuncts is evidenced by the following extract from R. Menassah Ben Israel (in lies, of the Dead, p. 254), who, commenting on Isa. 2:12-17, “For the day of the Lord of hosts,” etc., remarks: “It is not to be doubted, as we shall demonstrate in the sequel, that by ‘the day of the Lord’ the prophet intends ‘the day of judgment,’ which is otherwise called ‘the day of the resurrection of the dead.’91 Again (B. 3, c. 2), he says, on Mai. 4:5, “That great and terrible day of the Lord is the day of judgment, which shall be conjoined with the resurrection.” The day of Messiah, the day of judgment, the day of resurrection, the day of the Lord, etc., were all associated in the Jewish mind with the predicted coming and reign of the Messiah.
### Apostolic usage
>Obs. 2. Next, it is important to notice, (1) how the inspired apostles adopted this phraseology, applying it to Jesus, and (2) locating this “day that the Jews expected, in the future.
