# Proposition 138. This doctrine of the Kingdom fully corroborated by “the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.”

### Props Mentioned
133 159

>This Kingdom is after the Sec. Advent, and in a period, dispensation, age, day, or time, which, owing to the public, personal manifestation of Jesus Christ, is by way of *pre-eminence* entitled “His day;” etc. Now, if it can be shown that the Jews believed that the day or age of the Messiah was *thus identified* with the period of the reign of the Messiah on David’s throne, and that the Apostles, without any change or transformation, *apply* this phraseology to Jesus *after* His Sec. Advent, it at once *powerfully confirms* our doctrine of the Kingdom. For, if our interpretation of the Covenant and promises is correct, then such a day or time of Christ must be *still future*.
>p. 409 Vol. 2 Prop. 138
### The Jewish view
>Obs. 1. The Jewish view is given by many writers.
>...
>How later Jews continued to hold this notion of the day thus linked with these adjuncts is evidenced by the following extract from R. Menassah Ben Israel (in *Res. of the Dead*, p. 254), who, commenting on Isa. 2:12-17, “For the day of the Lord of hosts,” etc., remarks: “It is not to be doubted, as we shall demonstrate in the sequel, that by ‘*the day of the Lord*’ the prophet intends ‘*the day of judgment*,’ which is otherwise called ‘*the day of the resurrection of the dead*.’ Again (B. 3, c. 2), he says, on Mal. 4:5, “That great and terrible *day of the Lord is the day of judgment*, which shall be *conjoined* with the resurrection.” The day of Messiah, the day of judgment, the day of resurrection, the day of the Lord, etc., were *all* associated in the Jewish mind *with* the predicted coming and reign of the Messiah.
>p. 409 Vol. 2 Prop. 138 Obs. 1
### Apostolic usage
>Obs. 2. Next, it is important to notice, (1) how the inspired apostles *adopted* this phraseology, applying it to Jesus, and (2) locating this “*day*," that the Jews expected, *in the future*.
