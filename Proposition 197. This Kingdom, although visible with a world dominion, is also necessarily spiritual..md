>While a purely material, naturalistic Kingdom, without spirituality, is unscriptural, so likewise an entire spiritual Kingdom, without the sanctified union of the material or natural, is utterly opposed to the Word of God.
### Visible, external, world-dominion
>Obs. 1. Any reader that has followed the scriptural line of argument can see for himself that we are logically and irresistibly driven to the conclusion that the future Messianic Kingdom is a visible, external, world-dominion.

>The same Kingdom in which God ruled on earth as an earthly king is to be reinstated. To this all the prophets with one voice testify, and this is the one postponed to the Second Advent.
>Obs. 1

### Not carnal, fleshly
>Obs. 2. Because we contend that the fallen down tabernacle of David is to be restored with increased splendor and glory by David’s Son, “the Son of Man,” at His return, as the Scriptures abundantly declare, it is asserted by those who do not fathom the depth of the Theocratic idea also pertaining to it that our view is materialistic, carnal, fleshly, etc.

### Earthly ruler
>The simple fact that in a Theocracy God again dwells with man and becomes truly the earthly Ruler, is sufficient of itself to sustain our Prop.
>Obs. 3
### Perfect union of church and state
>Obs. 4. The perfect and harmonious union of Church and State, an essential in a Theocracy under the Headship of Jesus, the Mighty One, is in itself evidence of the correctness of our position. Here we find a blending of the material and the spiritual, of the outward and the inward, the external and invisible, and a separation of these cannot be made without violating the union that God has proclaimed shall be made.
### Not merely carnal nor merely spiritual
>Obs. 5. Would David’s Son, the glorified and exalted Son, come to this world to inherit a carnal Kingdom? Or, would He come to inherit a purely spiritual one? Neither of these would meet the terms of the expressed inheritance.
### A Spirit permeated kingdom
>Obs. 6. Consider that in this Kingdom, of which the elect nation is the basis and the other nations willing subjects, the glorified Son of David is King and His glorified brethren are co-rulers, and from the very nature and exaltation of the heads of government, we clearly perceive the spirituality allied with it. Resurrected, translated, glorified, immortal rulers must exhibit in their official stations, actions, rule, intercourse such a divine mind, such a holy spirit, such a refinement of pure affection, that the Kingdom under their jurisdiction becomes permeated, controlled, and established in a spirituality, arising from the mental, moral, and religious, exceeding our present ability to grasp.
### Priesthood of the saints, Royal priesthood
>Obs. 7. The Priesthood of the saints (Prop. 156), a Royal Priesthood, evinces the same. The baptism of the Spirit then (Prop. 171) experienced, declares unmistakably the pervading, and powerfully contained spirituality.
### Powerful spirituality
>Obs. 8. The wondrous power exerted by this Theocratic ordering in its King and associated rulers, so that it even extends to the deliverance of creation, the final and complete removal of the curse, exhibits a spirituality far beyond our comprehension.
### Sublime display of spirituality
>Obs. 9. The remarkable, astounding outpouring of the Holy Spirit us presented in the Millennial descriptions (Prop. 171, etc.), so powerful in its transforming, glorifying, and imparting miraculous gifts to the saints; so pervading in and over the Jewish nation that all shall be righteous from the least to the greatest; so wide-reaching over the Gentiles that they shall rejoice in the light bestowed; and so extended in its operation that the whole earth shall ultimately be covered with glory—this, with the magnificent portrayals of the Millennial and succeeding ages, is so sublime with the indwelling, abiding, communicated Divine, that no one can contemplate it, without being profoundly moved at the display of spirituality.
### Upon this earth
>Obs. 10. We insist, in strict accord with the Scriptures, that this spirituality is manifested, not in the third heaven, not outside of this world, but in this world, upon this earth.
### Not in third heaven nor in the air
>The Davidic throne (on which Jesus, as the Son of Man is to sit) and Kingdom (in which He abides to govern) to be restored, is neither in the third heaven nor in the air.
>Obs. 10
