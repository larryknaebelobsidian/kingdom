> . . . God makes long and secret preparations for important events; . . .
> p. 148 Vol. 1 Prop. 13 Obs. 1

> If everything relating to the Kingdom would have been clearly revealed, in a systematic order,  we are confident that such would have been *the hatred of earthly kingdoms* toward it, that no believer in it would have been safe, and, in consequence, the work of gathering out the elect would have been seriously impeded.
>  p. 148 Vol. 1 Prop. 13 Obs. 1

> God, foreseeing this antagonism as directed by "the god of this world, " does not unnecessarily excite it by *a premature* disclosure of all things, but gives us the truth in detached portions, some of it veiled under prophecy, others under symbolical language, etc., so that His preparations, patiently conducted, may go on to a successful completion, and the Kingdom be suddenly -- unexpectedly to many -- manifested.
> p. 148 Vol. 1 Prop. 13 Obs. 1

### Obs. 2

> The Lord has always represented the events He announced by the prophets in such a manner, that they were *sufficiently clear* for him who approached with reverence and careful thought, and yet *sufficiently dark and veiled* not to limit the freedom of human action.  For if the unchangeable decrees of the Eternal were presented to our eyes in unveiled features, *what* would become of the responsibility of man, of the free movements of human life, *what* of courage, and hope, and joy?
> p. 148-149 Vol. 1 Prop. 13 Obs. 2

### Obs. 3

> It is only fully known to God, and *an indefiniteness* is purposely thrown around it to keep us in the posture of constant expectation and watching.
