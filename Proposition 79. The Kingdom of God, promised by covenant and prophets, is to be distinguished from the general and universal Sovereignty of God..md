# Proposition 79. The Kingdom of God, promised by covenant and prophets, is to be distinguished from the general and universal Sovereignty of God.

>... *the Kingdom of covenant is a visible, outward Theocratic Kingdom*, manifested here on earth, identified with a certain people, promised in a definite manner, and ruled over by “the man ordained.” As we shall show hereafter (Prop. 81), it is a Kingdom specifically promised to the “*the Son of Man*,” who is the Son of David. These, and other aspects of it, clearly *distinguish it from* such a sovereignty.
>p. 556 Vol. 1 Prop. 79
### Even some opponents of Chiliasm see a difference between sovereign rule and theocratic rule
>Obs. 1. It is but justice to say that many of our opponents (as e.g. Thompson, etc.) and others (as e.g. Van Oosterzee, etc.) *justly discriminate* between this Kingdom and God’s Sovereignty, telling us that we must not make this Kingdom denote the Supremacy of God as manifested in Creation and Providence, in His “Universal Government over this and other worlds.”
>...
>They teach us that the one is given by covenant promise, and that the other ever existed, even before this special Kingdom was promised to man.
>...
>And they happily direct us to two passages, given by the same writer, as illustrative of the two, viz.: Dan. 6:26 and 7:13-14.

### Others do not distinguish
>Obs. 2. Others, however, do not discern between things that differ, ...

### Works of Systematic Divinity
>Obs. 3. It is noticeable that in works of Sys. Divinity this Sovereignty is placed under the part pertaining to God and His general government, and is separated from the promised Kingdom of Christ by treating of the latter under the Part relating to Christ and His work.
>...
>For, uniting the two and making them one, they at once make that, which they tell us was never (even for a moment), intermitted, the subject of recorded promises as something to come, to be inherited, etc.
>p. 557 Vol. 1 Prop. 79 Obs. 3
### Previous arguments demonstrate the difference
>Obs. 4. The line of argument already presented (which forms but a small portion of the Scriptural reasons to be assigned), is amply *sufficient* to show, that *a specified Theocratic Kingdom*, incorporating the Davidic throne, which once existed, which was withdrawn, and which is promised to be restored under David’s Son, is something *widely different* from the general Sovereignty of the Almighty over the universe. So plain, and simple, and self-evident is this Proposition, that no more space is required in its consideration.
