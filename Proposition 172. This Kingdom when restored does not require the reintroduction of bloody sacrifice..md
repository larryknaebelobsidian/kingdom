# Proposition 172. This Kingdom when restored does not require the reintroduction of bloody sacrifice.

>The Theocratic arrangement binds together into one the Church and State, manifesting in wonderful condescension God ruling as earthly Ruler in and through David’s Son. This by no means demands the restoration of Mosaic sacrifices, seeing that the King, in virtue of His sinlessness, perfection, etc., made *one sacrifice* which is *amply sufficient* to cover all redemptive purposes in the past, present and future. Heb. 7:22-27. The perfection and completeness of the sacrifice is insisted upon, as e.g. Heb, 10:1-18. There is nothing, therefore, in the Kingdom itself, i.e. in a Theocratic rule, which should cause us either directly or by implication, to advocate a return to sacrifices, which “*could not make perfect*” (Heb. 9:9), which were “*a shadow of good things to come*” (Heb. 10:1), and which would seem by their restoration to lessen the value and perfection of Christ’s offering of Himself. Indeed, if, as our argument indicates, this Kingdom, by virtue of Christ’s work and the efficacy of His blood in sealing and fulfilling the covenant, is a bringing the world back into its Edenic state as it would have existed without the introduction and results of human depravity, then such a restored state, *to exhibit justice* to the merits which brings in its restoration, should be one *in which bloody sacrifices do not exist*.

### Not taught in Bible; Not commemorative, not retrospective
>Obs. 1. Attention is called to the question of sacrifices in this form, seeing that Dr. Brown (The Sec. Coming, etc.), Dr. Hodge (Sys. Div.), Dr. Rice (Signs of the Times), etc., make the advocacy of a return to sacrifices (as is done by some Millenarians, e.g. D. N. Lord, Tyso, Shimeall, Begg, etc.), a serious objection to the reception of our doctrine. They allege that such a restoration would be a return to “bondage,” “beggarly elements,” etc., and that it invalidates the sufficiency of Christ’s offering. We are free to admit, that if our system *necessarily* involves such a restoration of sacrifice it would indeed form a grave objection against our view in the light of Galatians and Hebrews. The argumentation of its advocates that such sacrifices are merely “commemorative,” “retrospective,” etc., do not help the matter very much, so that while the objection is not sufficiently strong in itself to set-aside all the other truths pertaining to this subject, yet it is ample enough to cause hesitation and doubt in the minds of many. Fully agreeing with the idea that if such a return is clearly taught, it should not hinder us from accepting it, even if we cannot reconcile its readoption; fully persuaded also, that if taught, it would not be essential to our doctrine being connected with the revelations and arrangements of “the world to come yet the question naturally arises whether such a restoration of sacrifices is really taught. After carefully regarding the prophecies and weighing the reasoning assigned in its behalf, we are forced to the conclusion, that it is nowhere taught in the Bible; that, therefore, no such apparent “contradiction,” as our opponents allege, can be legitimately forced upon our system; and that as some of our friends have supposed, the sacrifices are not necessary to “illustrate the great work of Redemption,” and to bring out more “significantly” faith in Christ’s offering. The reasons for taking such a position follow.
>p. 84-84 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 1
### Not what many others think
>It is universally agreed that the main, leading argument in favor of a return to sacrifices is found in the last chapters of Ezekiel.
>p. 84 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 2
### Ezekiel's conditional Temple 
>Taking the position that this prophecy is *conditional*, we muse present other reasons than those last alleged in order to keep within the limits assigned under Prop. 18. For, no prediction ought to be regarded as such, unless it contains within itself, or in the context, or future explanation, the elements *clearly indicative of conditionality*. Ezekiel’s prediction unmistakably contains *the requisite evidence*, which places it clearly among the conditional prophecies. The key to it is found in ch. 43:7-11 where the re-establishment of the Theocratic rule *is conditioned by “now let them put away their whoredom and the carcasses of their kings, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever’ “if they be ashamed of all that they have done,”* etc. It is expressly asserted that this prediction is given, *“that they may be ashamed of their iniquities”* in order that what is promised may also be verified. The simple question to be asked is this: did the Jewish nation after the prophecy was given *repent* of its sinfulness and manifest by its shame that *it was worthy* of such a reconstruction of the government? Let the facts as given in history witness, and we are forced to the conclusion that the reason *why* no such Theocratic restoration (compare Jer. 17:25 with context—same conditionally expressed) was affected, was owing simply to *the lack* of a national repentance commensurate with a bringing it into operation. The repentance and acknowledgments of individuals and of a portion of the nation, is not sufficient to bring back this richly forfeited blessing. If it be asked, *why* does God give this lengthy prediction foreknowing that it will never, in the shape given, be realized owing to continued national sinfulness and unworthiness, the answer is plain: judging from other portions of the Word, it is done in necessary accommodation to the free agency of man. Let the reader consider, that this prophet predicts this *previous* to a partial restoration of the nation to its own land. Now in connection with even such a foreknown restoration, it is eminently proper for God to offer also (*conditioned by repentance*, as at the First Advent, see Props. 57, 58, etc.), a restoration of the Theocratic government. This, as every student admits, is done here, and we may reasonably conclude, that *if the conditions* imposed by God *had been accepted* by the nation, then all would have been abundantly verified. Hence as the conditions were not complied with—only in a very imperfect manner and which never resulted in a widespread and continuous reformation—the prophet gives us *a sad representation of blessings that were lost*, and most fully answers the question, *what* the state of the Jewish nation *would have been* provided it had on its restoration been obedient to God. Taking this view of it, the prediction is *necessary* in filling out what otherwise would prove a *blank* in Jewish history. It teaches us *in what form the Theocracy would have been restored*, had the Jews been “ashamed,” etc., thus manifesting God’s willingness to bless and His love for His people and land.

### The key is Ezekiel 43:7-11
### Conditional on national obedience

#### In necessary accommodation to the free agency of man
>. . . the reason *why* no such Theocratic restoration (compare Jer. 17:25 with context—same conditionally expressed) was affected, was owing simply to *the lack* of a national repentance commensurate with a bringing it into operation. The repentance and acknowledgments of individuals and of a portion of the nation, is not sufficient to bring back this richly forfeited blessing. If it be asked, *why* does God give this lengthy prediction foreknowing that it will never, in the shape given, be realized owing to continued national sinfulness and unworthiness, the answer is plain: judging from other portions of the Word, it is done in necessary accommodation to the free agency of man
>p. 86 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 3 (extracted again from above for emphasis)
#### Be guarded in our interpretation
>The Jews no doubt will be largely influenced by Ezekiel to attempt, during their partial Pre-Millennial restoration to Palestine, to carry out this prediction in the building of a temple, a return to the Mosaic ritual in which bloody sacrifices will be again prominently brought forth.  Jewish writers (according to Fairbairn) have maintained that this prediction was imperfectly realized after the captivity and under Herod, but that "it waits to be properly accomplished by the Messiah, who, when He appears, shall cause the temple to be reared precisely as here described, and carry out all the other subordinate arrangements." We should, therefore, in our interpretation of Ezekiel, be guarded lest, indirectly, we encourage through it such a restoration. Exhibiting and enforcing its past conditionality, we give them no hope of such a realization and yet preserve intact the integrity, apparent meaning, etc. , of the text.  Fairbairn and others denominate this Jewish idea of its real meaning is far superior to their own figurative view, for it accords -- as the identity of particular description shows -- with the language and particularism of the Pentateuch.  If the one can be spiritualized at the will of the interpreter, so also may the other.
>p. 86 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 3 note
### Preparative
>Obs 4. Having thus shown the conditionality of the prediction fairly expressed within itself, we may now add, that *the entire structure* of the prophecy indicates that it by no means refers to the final fulfilment of the covenant, but is also *preparative* to such a fulfilment.
>p. 86 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 4

>... it is *simply impossible*, with any degree of consistency, to apply and interpret this prophecy as relating to the promised Messiah’s reign. To do this, is *to violate* the intent of this Scripture, the sublime descriptions of the character and perfection of Christ, and to fasten upon our doctrine *an unnecessary, and unbelief producing*, interpretation.
>p. 87 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 4
### Theocratic in nature, not identity
>Obs. 5. The highly significant phraseology combined with this prophecy, such as “*the name of the city from that day shall be, the Lord is there*,” etc., has led many to suppose that this alone is applicable to the era after the Second Advent when Christ shall personally come and reign, and thus “the Lord is there,” etc.
>...
>The fact, that similar language can be used in reference to Christ’s reign, does not prove identity, but only shows, that His rule is also Theocratic in its nature and results.
>p. 88 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 5
### Not proof against the Kingdom
>Obs. 6. The conditionality of this prophecy, by no means can be adduced as proof (so Waggoner, etc.) that the Jews *will never* be restored and the Davidic kingdom *will never* be rebuilt.
>...
>Being strictly in the line of conditional prophecies, and delineating only *a provisional, preparatory stage* (not realized owing to sin), it does *not fall within the category of predictions relating to the fulfilment of the covenant in the person and the rule of Jesus Christ*. 
  p. 88-89 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 6
### Hypocatastasis
>... *it is sufficient* to call attention to a mode of speech introduced into the Word which solves all such difficulties. It is a figure of speech called by Lord and others “hypocatastasis” by which one thing is employed as a substitute or equivalent for another.
>p. 89 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 7
### Sacrifice (hypocatastasis)
>This usage of the word, ‘sacrifice” shows that it is employed as *an equivalent* for worship or religious conduct in this dispensation, and to place the matter beyond all dispute it is expressly affirmed by Peter (1 Pet. 2:5, 9), that the design of this new order of priests, when thus gathered out and forming “a holy priesthood” “a royal priesthood,” is “*to offer up spiritual sacrifices*”and not bloody ones. This again is confirmed by what is stated in Mill, descriptions, and in promises pertaining to this future priesthood. Nowhere, including the last testimony given by Jesus (*Apoc.*), do we find these priests represented as offering to God the victims of a Mosaic ritual. Hence those isolated passages which speak of worship and sacrifice, even if they are clad in language which at first sight might suggest a return to the Mosaic ritual, are to be interpreted in the light of *the more extended* predictions, of *the changes* that are to be introduced in the coming dispensation, of *the express affirmations* concerning the future priesthood, and of *the examples* given in the usage of the word “sacrifice.” Otherwise an antagonism is raised, which is altogether unnecessary, and which leads to unfriendly doubt, and to rejection of other truths. If the ancient sacrifices were typical, if they were only “a shadow of things to come,” *then* we are fully warranted to regard such passages as presenting under a tropical sense (customary to all language) another kind of sacrifice, *suitable to the then existing dispensation*, and that *a new order* of priests, under the name of the old because a prolongation or continuation of a priesthood, are introduced as forever associated with Jesus in the age to come. Hence Heb. 9:28 will be realized.
>p. 89-90 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 7
### Temple (hypocatastasis)
>Admitting that in the earthly Jerusalem a temple will be rebuilt in order to manifest in a public manner the worship of God, yet much confusion of ideas is found in not noticing that the way in which the word is employed fully shows, that it does *not necessarily involve* the notion of a restoration of sacrifices.
>p. 90 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 8

Temple of Christ's body - John 2:19
Temple of The saints - 1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Cor. 6:16
Temple of The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb - Rev. 21:22

>This teaches us, that if we are not to press the word “temple” beyond its legitimate use in the Word, so also ought we not to press the word “sacrifice” which is associated with the temple. Figures of speech, lawfully drawn from the structure of language, and indicated thus by the Spirit, should have due weight in our interpretation.
