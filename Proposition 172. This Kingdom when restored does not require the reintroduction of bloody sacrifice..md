# Proposition 172. This Kingdom when restored does not require the reintroduction of bloody sacrifice.

>The Theocratic arrangement binds together into one the Church and State, manifesting in wonderful condescension God ruling as earthly Ruler in and through David’s Son. This by no means demands the restoration of Mosaic sacrifices, seeing that the King, in virtue of His sinlessness, perfection, etc., made *one sacrifice* which is *amply sufficient* to cover all redemptive purposes in the past, present and future. Heb. 7:22-27. The perfection and completeness of the sacrifice is insisted upon, as e.g. Heb, 10:1-18. There is nothing, therefore, in the Kingdom itself, i.e. in a Theocratic rule, which should cause us either directly or by implication, to advocate a return to sacrifices, which “*could not make perfect*” (Heb. 9:9), which were “*a shadow of good things to come*” (Heb. 10:1), and which would seem by their restoration to lessen the value and perfection of Christ’s offering of Himself. Indeed, if, as our argument indicates, this Kingdom, by virtue of Christ’s work and the efficacy of His blood in sealing and fulfilling the covenant, is a bringing the world back into its Edenic state as it would have existed without the introduction and results of human depravity, then such a restored state, *to exhibit justice* to the merits which brings in its restoration, should be one *in which bloody sacrifices do not exist*.

### Not taught in Bible; Not commemorative, not retrospective
>Obs. 1. Attention is called to the question of sacrifices in this form, seeing that Dr. Brown (The Sec. Coming, etc.), Dr. Hodge (Sys. Div.), Dr. Rice (Signs of the Times), etc., make the advocacy of a return to sacrifices (as is done by some Millenarians, e.g. D. N. Lord, Tyso, Shimeall, Begg, etc.), a serious objection to the reception of our doctrine. They allege that such a restoration would be a return to “bondage,” “beggarly elements,” etc., and that it invalidates the sufficiency of Christ’s offering. We are free to admit, that if our system *necessarily* involves such a restoration of sacrifice it would indeed form a grave objection against our view in the light of Galatians and Hebrews. The argumentation of its advocates that such sacrifices are merely “commemorative,” “retrospective,” etc., do not help the matter very much, so that while the objection is not sufficiently strong in itself to set-aside all the other truths pertaining to this subject, yet it is ample enough to cause hesitation and doubt in the minds of many. Fully agreeing with the idea that if such a return is clearly taught, it should not hinder us from accepting it, even if we cannot reconcile its readoption; fully persuaded also, that if taught, it would not be essential to our doctrine being connected with the revelations and arrangements of “the world to come yet the question naturally arises whether such a restoration of sacrifices is really taught. After carefully regarding the prophecies and weighing the reasoning assigned in its behalf, we are forced to the conclusion, that it is nowhere taught in the Bible; that, therefore, no such apparent “contradiction,” as our opponents allege, can be legitimately forced upon our system; and that as some of our friends have supposed, the sacrifices are not necessary to “illustrate the great work of Redemption,” and to bring out more “significantly” faith in Christ’s offering. The reasons for taking such a position follow.

### Not what many others think
>It is universally agreed that the main, leading argument in favor of a return to sacrifices is found in the last chapters of Ezekiel.

### Ezekiel's conditional Temple 
>Taking the position that this prophecy is *conditional*, we muse present other reasons than those last alleged in order to keep within the limits assigned under Prop. 18. For, no prediction ought to be regarded as such, unless it contains within itself, or in the context, or future explanation, the elements *clearly indicative of conditionality*. Ezekiel’s prediction unmistakably contains *the requisite evidence*, which places it clearly among the conditional prophecies. The key to it is found in ch. 43:7-11 where the re-establishment of the Theocratic rule *is conditioned by “now let them put away their whoredom and the carcasses of their kings, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever’ “if they be ashamed of all that they have done,”* etc. It is expressly asserted that this prediction is given, *“that they may be ashamed of their iniquities”* in order that what is promised may also be verified. The simple question to be asked is this: did the Jewish nation after the prophecy was given *repent* of its sinfulness and manifest by its shame that *it was worthy* of such a reconstruction of the government? Let the facts as given in history witness, and we are forced to the conclusion that the reason *why* no such Theocratic restoration (compare Jer. 17:25 with context—same conditionally expressed) was affected, was owing simply to *the lack* of a national repentance commensurate with a bringing it into operation. The repentance and acknowledgments of individuals and of a portion of the nation, is not sufficient to bring back this richly forfeited blessing. If it be asked, *why* does God give this lengthy prediction foreknowing that it will never, in the shape given, be realized owing to continued national sinfulness and unworthiness, the answer is plain: judging from other portions of the Word, it is done in necessary accommodation to the free agency of man. Let the reader consider, that this prophet predicts this *previous* to a partial restoration of the nation to its own land. Now in connection with even such a foreknown restoration, it is eminently proper for God to offer also (*conditioned by repentance*, as at the First Advent, see Props. 57, 58, etc.), a restoration of the Theocratic government. This, as every student admits, is done here, and we may reasonably conclude, that *if the conditions* imposed by God *had been accepted* by the nation, then all would have been abundantly verified. Hence as the conditions were not complied with—only in a very imperfect manner and which never resulted in a widespread and continuous reformation—the prophet gives us *a sad representation of blessings that were lost*, and most fully answers the question, *what* the state of the Jewish nation *would have been* provided it had on its restoration been obedient to God. Taking this view of it, the prediction is *necessary* in filling out what otherwise would prove a *blank* in Jewish history. It teaches us *in what form the Theocracy would have been restored*, had the Jews been “ashamed,” etc., thus manifesting God’s willingness to bless and His love for His people and land.

### The key is Ezekiel 43:7-11
### Conditional on national obedience

#### In necessary accommodation to the free agency of man
>. . . the reason *why* no such Theocratic restoration (compare Jer. 17:25 with context—same conditionally expressed) was affected, was owing simply to *the lack* of a national repentance commensurate with a bringing it into operation. The repentance and acknowledgments of individuals and of a portion of the nation, is not sufficient to bring back this richly forfeited blessing.

#### Be guarded in our interpretation
>The Jews no doubt will be largely influenced by Ezekiel to attempt, during their partial Pre-Millennial restoration to Palestine, to carry out this prediction in the building of a temple, a return to the Mosaic ritual in which bloody sacrifices will be again prominently brought forth.  Jewish writers (according to Fairbairn) have maintained that this prediction was imperfectly realized after the captivity and under Herod, but that "it waits to be properly accomplished by the Messiah, who, when He appears, shall cause the temple to be reared precisely as here described, and carry out all the other subordinate arrangements." We should, therefore, in our interpretation of Ezekiel, be guarded lest, indirectly, we encourage through it such a restoration. Exhibiting and enforcing its past conditionality, we give them no hope of such a realization and yet preserve intact the integrity, apparent meaning, etc. , of the text.  Fairbairn and others denominate this Jewish idea of its real meaning is far superior to their own figurative view, for it accords -- as the identity of particular description shows -- with the language and particularism of the Pentateuch.  If the one can be spiritualized at the will of the interpreter, so also may the other.
>p. 86 Vol. 3 Prop 172 Obs. 3 note
### Preparative
>Obs 4. Having thus shown the conditionality of the prediction fairly expressed within itself, we may now add, that *the entire structure* of the prophecy indicates that it by no means refers to the final fulfilment of the covenant, but is also *preparative* to such a fulfilment.
