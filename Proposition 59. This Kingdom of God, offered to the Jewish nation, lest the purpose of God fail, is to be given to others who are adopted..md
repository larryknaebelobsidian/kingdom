>This Kingdom is incorporated by covenant promise with the seed of Abraham; that seed is chosen, but refusing the Kingdom on the condition annexed to it, now, that the Divine Purpose revealed in the covenants may *not fail* in its accomplishment through the unbelief and depravity of the nation, another seed must be raised up *unto Abraham*, to whom the Kingdom, in a peculiar sense (as will be explained hereafter), is to be given.
>p. 386 Vol. 1 Prop 59
### Parable of the wicked husbandmen
>In Matt. 21, *after* the chief priests and scribes and elders manifested their opposition to Him, and *after* He had told (v. 31) them, “Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you” (i.e. in view of their repentance and faith, they became *heirs* of the Kingdom), then He gives the parable of the wicked husbandmen, who not only rejected and killed the servants, but finally even *the heir* (v. 33-46). When the Jews answered Christ’s question concerning what the lord of the vineyard would do in such a case, He accepts of their reply (*condemnatory* of themselves), and shows that He (the Stone) has been rejected, and adds: “*therefore* (i.e. on account of their refusing to receive Him), *I say unto you, the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof*. Now let the reader carefully consider: (1) The Kingdom of God *taken from* them. This Kingdom belonged *exclusively* to them (comp. Props. 24, 29, 31, 49, 54,55). It was theirs by covenant relationship; but, having made themselves unworthy of it, the tender was withdrawn, and it was to be *given to others*. (2) The Kingdom was to be given to a nation, a people, who, by the fruits resulting from obedience through faith, should show themselves *worthy* of it.
>p. 386 Vol. 1 Prop 59 Obs. 1
### Jews understood the parable
>Obs. 2. Additionally, in this declaration of Jesus, we have—
>(1) the Kingdom which is taken from them is one, which, it is taken for granted, that *the Jews comprehended*, viz. *the covenanted Kingdom*, the only Kingdom that they were acquainted with, thus corroborating our position. They well understood its force and propriety, and appreciated its application to themselves, saying, “God *forbid*.” 
>(2) They expected to receive this Kingdom solely in virtue of their national relationship *without observing* the condition of repentance annexed to the offer. 
>(3) They were *not to receive* the Kingdom within their reach, appertaining to them, owing to their great wickedness in rejecting and even killing, as a culmination of rebellion, *the Heir* Himself. 
>(4) *Another people* was to receive it. This at once opens some interesting questions, which, if we desire to appreciate the Divine Purpose and to prevent its assuming the changeable aspect of human plans diverted and altered by contingencies, demand on our part *due consideration*.

### Must be closely related to the Jewish race
>Obs. 3. This already teaches us that to preserve *the solemnly-pledged faithfulness* of God, this people, to whom the Kingdom is to be given, must, in the very nature of the case, stand *closely related* to the Jewish race. They cannot be gathered out or selected, as multitudes now vainly imagine and foolishly boast, *without any regard whatever* to the old covenanted line. They must be, if God is sincere and mindful of His oath, *adopted as Abraham’s seed* (comp. Props. 29, 30, etc.).
>p. 387 Vol. 1 Prop 59 Obs. 3
### Wisdom and power of God amply sufficient
>Obs. 4. John the Baptist had already foreshown that the wisdom and power of God would be amply sufficient to carry out His own covenanted Purpose, even if the nation would reject Christ.
>p. 387 Vol. 1 Prop 59 Obs. 4

>Here are several suggestive ideas that we ought, by all means, to keep in mind: 
>(1) that standing in the covenant relationship (being “children of the Kingdom”) as the mere natural offspring or descendants of Abraham *without repentance and obedience* is not sufficient. To insure the Kingdom in their case, *both* are required; for the Theocratic ordering calls for moral preparation (e.g. Rom. 2:28, 29) as well as for union with the Fathers to whom the covenant was given. 
>(2) That God is *abundantly able* to raise up *children unto Abraham*, so that, if necessity required it, they could be raised up even from stones. 
>(3) That God would perform so miraculous a creative act *rather than* leave His covenant promises unfulfilled. 
>(4) But even when this would be done, the covenant relationship would be sustained *in their being, by adoption, the children of Abraham*. 
>(5) Hence, the promises are recognized *as given to Abraham, and to inherit with Abraham it is requisite to come into covenant relationship with him*.

### A national removal
>The reader will observe that this removal of the Kingdom is *a national one*. (It *necessarily* is such because identified with the nation.) Various writers have fallen into gross mistakes on this point, and quote the passages relating to it *as if* all the Jews that ever lived had forfeited and lost their right to the Kingdom. The fact is, that the believing portion who had died *will yet* receive it, the believing portion who now accept of it *will likewise* obtain it, and the Gentiles who by faith are engrafted *will also* receive it.
>p. 388 Vol. 1 Prop 59 Obs. 5
### Mistake some make that removal is permanent
>Another mistake into which many fall must be corrected, viz.: that the Kingdom being *taken from* them, it will *never be given* to the nation again.
>p. 388 Vol. 1 Prop 59 Obs. 6

>Now here we must ask the indulgence of the reader, for a number of things which serve *to explain* this remarkable language are reserved for separate propositions, and, therefore, no decided and satisfactory explanation can be presented before passing over these. This much, by way of preliminary, may be stated:
>(1) that those *then* addressed, the nation as existing down to the present day, *cannot* (excepting individual believers) *inherit* the Kingdom in the higher sense (intimated by giving) *of Kingship and priesthood, co-heirship* with Christ; 
>(2) that the nation, *as such*, by its wickedness, *forfeited the high position of rulership* with Christ, which individual believers will receive from film at its ultimate re-establishment; 
>(3) but this does *not prevent the final restoration* of the nation to its covenanted position *in order to secure* (a) the establishment of the Theocratic-Davidic throne and Kingdom, and (b) the special bestowal of this Kingdom to this very nation gathered out; 
>(4) hence, Jesus, whilst directly asserting *the forfeiture of a high privilege, does not add*, as many suppose, that the nation itself *shall never again* enjoy the blessings of the Theocratic Kingdom, but in a subordinated position; 
>(5) for this Scripture must be interpreted, *not isolated*, but in connection with others relating to the same subject.
>p. 388 Vol. 1 Prop 59 Obs. 6
### Peculiar, special relation to the kingdom
>Obs. 8. The Kingdom had come nigh to the nation (in the tender of it, in the person of the Messiah, and in covenant relationship leading to the restrictive preaching), and the nation, therefore, must have sustained *a peculiar, special relation to it*, or else it could not have been taken from them. To be taken from them is indicative of the nation’s having *a claim* upon it (as we have all along demonstrated).
>p. 389 Vol. 1 Prop 59 Obs. 8
### "The kingdom of God has come upon you"
>Obs. 9. This taking away of the Kingdom from the nation to whom it belonged as a covenanted right, and thus giving it to others, serves to explain the phraseology ... Luke 11:20, "*the Kingdom of God has come upon you*." ... Luke 17:21 "*the Kingdom of God is among (or within) you*."
