>This Kingdom is incorporated by covenant promise with the seed of Abraham; that seed is chosen, but refusing the Kingdom on the condition annexed to it, now, that the Divine Purpose revealed in the covenants may *not fail* in its accomplishment through the unbelief and depravity of the nation, another seed must be raised up *unto Abraham*, to whom the Kingdom, in a peculiar sense (as will be explained hereafter), is to be given.

>In Matt. 21, *after* the chief priests and scribes and elders manifested their opposition to Him, and *after* He had told (v. 31) them, “Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you” (i.e. in view of their repentance and faith, they became *heirs* of the Kingdom), then He gives the parable of the wicked husbandmen, who not only rejected and killed the servants, but finally even *the heir* (v. 33-46). When the Jews answered Christ’s question concerning what the lord of the vineyard would do in such a case, He accepts of their reply (*condemnatory* of themselves), and shows that He (the Stone) has been rejected, and adds: “*therefore* (i.e. on account of their refusing to receive Him), *I say unto you, the Kingdom of God shall be taken front you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof*. Now let the reader carefully consider: (1) The Kingdom of God *taken from* them. This Kingdom belonged *exclusively* to them (comp. Props. 24, 29, 31, 49, 54,55). It was theirs by covenant relationship; but, having made themselves unworthy of it, the tender was withdrawn, and it was to be *given to others*. (2) The Kingdom was to be given to a nation, a people, who, by the fruits resulting from obedience through faith, should show themselves *worthy* of it.

>The reader will observe that this removal of the Kingdom is *a national one*. (It *necessarily* is such because identified with the nation.) Various writers have fallen into gross mistakes on this point, and quote the passages relating to it *as if* all the Jews that ever lived had forfeited and lost their right to the Kingdom. The fact is, that the believing portion who had died *will yet* receive it, the believing portion who now accept of it *will likewise* obtain it, and the Gentiles who by faith are engrafted *will also* receive it.

>Another mistake into which many fall must be corrected, viz.: that the Kingdom being taken from them, it will never be given to the nation again.
