2 Peter 3:10-13 (LSB)
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be found _out_. 11 Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, 12 looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens burning will be destroyed, and the elements will melt with intense heat! 13 But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.

>This *is self-evident*, since this Kingdom is identified with the establishment of “the new heavens and new earth” of Isa. 65:17, and 66:22. Peter *expressly* alludes to these two passages in Isaiah and *appropriates them* as descriptive of “the new heavens and new earth” presented by himself, in the specific phraseology, “*according to promise*.” The *Millennial* new heavens and new earth *thus claimed* by the Apostle, and which are associated with the Kingdom itself, are *necessarily preceded* by the fire described. As this forms the leading objection to our doctrine, and as some have wrongfully (against *the most explicit* language of Peter) endeavored endeavored to locate this fire *after* the thousand years, it is proper to thus definitely state the facts and assume their weight.

>It has been noticed by various Commentators, etc., that the Jews, before and at the time Peter wrote, expected that the Millennial era, i.e. the times of Messiah’s reign, *would be introduced by great convulsions and a terrible fire*. Knapp, in using the word “perishing” as many do, goes too far when he says (*Christ. Theol*., s. 155, II. 2): “This doctrine of the perishing of the world by fire was unquestionably prevalent among the Jews at the time of Christ and the apostles, although Philo does not accede to it.” That the Jews believed in a mighty change, in a renovation, purification, regeneration (see Knapp, same place, quoting Philo), etc., of the earth, and that in some way *fire* (as the prophets predicted) should be employed as an agency, seems certain from various testimony, but that they believed in so widespread and extensive a conflagration as moderns have fastened upon Peter, is not only *unproven but hostile to the expectations* they had concerning the Messiah’s Kingdom. A little reflection should suggest, that a people who looked for *the restoration* of the Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom over the nation in the flesh, which Kingdom was ultimately to embrace the Gentile nations, *could not, and did not*, believe in that which would utterly demolish all hope. But, as stated, they did believe that this Kingdom would be preceded by the awful judgments of God, and that fire would be used in connection with them. Now the language of Peter *accords* with the belief that *before* the Millennial period could Be introduced, such *a Pre-Millennial judgment* by fire must be inflicted; and his undoubted reference to *the only promises* relating to the new heavens and new earth in Isaiah would *immediately and inevitably*— with the prevailing belief—direct the Jewish mind *to the Millennial* prophecies. If the latter are to be understood, as so many now teach, to be fulfilled prior to this conflagration, *then* Peter took the very means and language *to confirm* his readers in the opposite view. We hold that there is *no antagonism* between Peter and the Jewish belief on the subject.
