>Whatever churchly or religious organization existed among the Jews after the overthrow of the Kingdom, they themselves, as we have shown, did not regard the Kingdom of God as existing just prior to the First Advent.
### Jews did not realize they were living in the kingdom
>Obs. 1. This Proposition in this form is the more necessary, since many writers spiritualizing this reign into “God’s reign in the heart,” “piety,” etc., endeavor to make out that the Kingdom was actually realized without the cognizance of the Jews, and in opposition to the first preaching.
### Kingdom is not a continuation of the Jewish Church
>Obs. 2. This Proposition is yielded to us by many of our opponents, some already quoted, who make the Christian Church something new, and hence a Kingdom in a form in which it did not previously exist, although a continuation of the Jewish Church.
### Contradictory statements
>Obs. 3. We find on this point the most contradictory statements.
### Pious Jews at first advent were not in the kingdom
>Obs. 4. Any definition of the Kingdom under Christ, which affirms nothing more than was experienced by the pious Jews at the First Advent, is most certainly defective.
### Church before Theocracy was not the prophesied kingdom
>Obs. 5. The reader’s attention is recalled to our argument which clearly shows, under Propositions pertaining to the covenants, etc., that the Church itself as it existed before the formation of the Theocracy was no Kingdom here on earth; that such a Kingdom was first presented when the Theocratic form of government was instituted, God Himself condescending to act in the capacity of an earthly Ruler over the nation, and State and Church were firmly united in mutual support.
### The church always existed but it is not the kingdom
>Obs. 6. It is right, therefore, to say, that the Church has always existed and even, as some do, to declare, that the Christian is a continuation of the previous Church in another form and with added privileges; but it wrong to assert that the Church, without the previously ordained Theocratic order in actual union with it, is the Kingdom of God in the sense given by covenant and Prophets.
### Example
>Obs. 7. To illustrate how the Jewish Church is elevated, in a circumlocutory way, to the position of a Kingdom, we select an example.
