# Proposition 20. To comprehend the subject of the kingdom, it is necessary to notice the belief and the expectations of the more pious portion of the Jews.

### Props Mentioned
16 19

>This is a rule, covering doctrine, laid down by the ablest of writers; ...
>p. 183 Vol. 1 Prop. 20
### Pious Jewish view of the Messiah
>Obs. 1. It is universally admitted by writers of prominence (e.g. Neander, Hagenbach, Schaff, Kurtz, etc.), whatever their respective views concerning the Kingdom itself, that the Jews, including the pious, held to *a personal* coming of the Messiah, *the literal* restoration of the Davidic throne and kingdom, the personal reign of Messiah *on David’s throne*, *the resultant* exaltation of Jerusalem and the Jewish nation, and *the fulfilment* of the Millennial descriptions in that reign.
>p. 183 Vol. 1 Prop. 20 Obs. 1
### No rebuke from Jesus and disciples on kingdom beliefs
>Obs. 2. It is noticeable, that in all the rebukes given to the Jews by John the Baptist, by Jesus and the apostles, not one refers to their belief and expectations concerning the Kingdom. The rebukes pertain to their superstition, traditions, bigotry, hypocrisy, pride, ostentation, violation of duty, etc., but nothing is alleged that they *misapprehended* the Kingdom of the prophets in its fundamental aspects.
>p. 184 Vol. 1 Prop. 20 Obs. 2
### Examples of Jewish belief in the Messiah
>Obs. 5. If, in support of our Prop., Jews were selected, who are not approvingly mentioned in the New Test., it might be alleged that they misconceived the truth.
>p. 185 Vol. 1 Prop. 20 Obs. 5

>In confirmation of our position, we appeal to the expressed views of Elizabeth and Zacharias, of Mary and Joseph.
>p. 185 Vol. 1 Prop. 20 Obs. 5
### Many scholars claim ancient Jewish faith unreliable and inapplicable
>Obs. 6. A large class, to make the ancient Jewish faith unreliable and inapplicable, fully admit the same, but then gravely misjudge the belief by pointing to the result, i.e. *the non-realization* of their faith, as evidence that the Jews were *mistaken* and wholly *ignorant* of the true idea of the Kingdom.
>p. 186 Vol. 1 Prop. 20 Obs. 6
### Many scholars stumble over non-fulfillment at first advent
>Obs. 7. Another large class, agreeing with the former in the result, inform us that the non-fulfilment of the Jewish Messianic Kingdom expectations, indicates a Jewish misapprehension of Scripture language; and that hence, however the grammatical construction may demand it, the language, covenant and prophetical, expressive of such a faith must be interpreted to correspond with the result thus far attained. The non-fulfilment becomes both the rejecter of the ancient faith and the apologist for applying *a spiritualistic* interpretation.
>p. 187 Vol. 1 Prop. 20 Obs. 7
### Church apologetics makes too many concessions
>Obs. 8. The Apologetics of the Church makes too many concessions to unbelievers respecting the Jewish and Primitive faith, and, alas, too many sneers—according well with the ridicule of infidelity—are cast at their “low,” ‘grovelling,” “carnal” views of the Kingdom.
>p. 188 Vol. 1 Prop. 20 Obs. 8
### Must investigate the Old Testament grammatically
>... *without an investigation* of the Old Test., from whence the Jews and the first Christians obtained their views and expectations, it is simply impossible to obtain *a correct idea* of the Kingdom.
>p. 188 Vol. 1 Prop. 20 Obs. 9

>God *will not, cannot* produce a faith by the unvarnished grammatical sense of His Word, existing for many centuries, and *then* supersede it by another through men engrafting a different meaning upon *the identical* Scriptures which led to the former.
>p. 188 Vol. 1 Prop. 20 Obs. 9
### Preservative influence on the Jewish nation
>Obs. 10. The belief in this Kingdom had a preservative influence upon the Jewish nation.
>p. 189 Vol. 1 Prop. 20 Obs. 10
