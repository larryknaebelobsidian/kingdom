[[Proposition 163. This Kingdom will be preceded by the predicted “battle of that great day of God Almighty.”|163]] 

>We have conclusively shown that the covenant necessitates a resurrection; that the description of David’s Son, who is to reign, demands a descendant of David possessing, in some way, immortality, seeing that His rule is everlasting, thus implying a resurrection—that a resurrection is predicted of Him, etc.—and now the fair inference is that those selected to be His co-heirs, being gathered out during a long period of time, and having died “without receiving the promises,” must also experience the power of the resurrection before they can inherit the Kingdom of God.
>p. 227 Vol 2 Prop. 125

>Leaving the proof of this union of resurrection and Kingdom for the following Propositions (as we only desire now to introduce the subject of the resurrection), every reader, keeping in view that Christ’s appearing and Kingdom are united, 2 Tim. 4:1, that a resurrection follows His Second Advent, and that an inheriting of the Kingdom succeeds this appearing and resurrection, must concede that when the righteous “are recompensed at the resurrection of the just” (Luke 14:14), this also includes the inheriting of a Kingdom. So that, for the present, we are content with *the general tenor* of the Word, indicating *first* a resurrection and *then* the reception and enjoyment of a Kingdom.
>p. 227 Vol 2 Prop. 125 Obs. 1

>All along, the position has been taken that, owing to the postponement of the Kingdom, *a preliminary* dispensation of grace to us Gentiles has intervened, and that even the dead saints, whatever their position in this interval, are *waiting* until “*the day of Redemption*” the time of the resurrection for their inheritance, etc. This is confirmed by the language of Paul in 1 Cor. 15:32, who lays the greatest stress on the resurrection as *the necessary and appointed means* by which the blessings that are covenanted can be obtained.
>p. 227 Vol 2 Prop. 125 Obs. 2

>one of the doctrinal defects of the Reformation was, that the resurrection of Christ was not made sufficiently prominent as compared with His sacrificial death, while in the apostolic preaching the Crucified and the Risen held equal place. And this feature extended finally in an undue exaltation of the intermediate state, until the resurrection is almost practically ignored as of comparative little consequence to the honor, glory, etc., of the deceased saint. To appreciate the force and pertinency of the resurrection, there must be a return to the scriptural presentation of the matter.
>p. 228 Vol 2 Prop. 125 Obs. 2

>Hence, being penal and a result of the fall, perfect redemption through a perfect Redeemer must recover us from the same. (Comp. Prop. 163)
>p. 228 Vol 2 Prop. 125 Obs. 2 Note

>This resurrection includes *a resurrection of dead saints*, or, in other words, is a *corporeal, literal* resurrection.
>. . .
>an undoubted, veritable resurrection of *the bodies* of dead saints, *sufficiently distinctive* to preserve personal identity, and to make it recognizable to others as a real restoration from the dead.
>p. 228 Vol 2 Prop. 125 Obs. 3

>A line of argument can only (owing to lack of space) be indicated. 
>1. The resurrection necessitated by the covenant promises requires *the personal* resurrection and continued identity of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
>2. That applied to David’s Son demands *the same, and the distinctive preservation* of His humanity, so as to sustain a continued relationship to David as His Son. 
>3. The belief in a literal resurrection of the body, according to numerous writers, was a common one among the Jews at the time of Christ (Matt. 22; Luke 20; Acts 23:6-8; John 11:24, etc.), and the language of Christ and the apostles is *pre-eminently calculated* to confirm them in their belief. 
>4. That the language of Christ and the apostles taught such a resurrection, is confirmed by the fact that all the early churches *distinctively proclaimed it* as their faith, thus corroborating the views entertained by the Jews. And this general belief was not confined to Jewish but was embraced in the Gentile churches. 
>5. Seeing what immediately preceded and followed the First Advent in attachment to this doctrine, if an error, it seems reasonable to anticipate either from Christ or His apostles a plain and unequivocal denial of it. 
>6. But the Scriptures themselves establish the doctrine. This they do, 
>	(1) in *the usage* of words which denote both in classical and scriptural writings *a revivification of the dead*. 
>	(2) In applying these words *to deceased* persons in their graves.
	  (3) In representing those “asleep in *the dust of the earth*” those “*whose flesh rests in hope*” etc., as the ones who shall experience it. 
	  (4) In speaking of it as something *well understood*, as e.g. Acts 14:2 and 23:6, etc. 
	  (5) In declaring that the unjust (Acts 24:15), “*all in their graves*” John 5:28, 29, shall undergo its power, removing the idea of simple moral regeneration. 
	  (6) In appealing to us not to think it *incredible* that God should perform such a work, Acts 26:8; Heb. 11:19. 
	  (7) In *the examples* of dead persons being restored to life (e.g. Matt. 27:52, 53), which is a sign of what will be done at the Sec. Advent. 
	  (8) In *the body* being specifically mentioned, as e.g. Rom. 8:23 in “*the redemption of the body*” Phil. 3:10, 21. 
	  (9) In *the contrast* made between death and the resurrection from the dead (1 Cor. 15:21, 22), and in *the effects* of death and the consequences following the resurrection (1 Cor. 15:42-54). 
	  (10) In the rejection of those who *spiritualized* the resurrection, 2 Tim. 2:17, 18. 
	  (11) In the removal of it to a *certain fixed period*, Eph. 4:30; 1 Cor. 15:23; 1 Thess. 4:14, 17, etc. 
	  (12) In the fact that “*the first begotten of the dead*” underwent *a literal, corporeal* resurrection, as the various Gospels prove; that even in the process of glorification following it He retains His personal identity sufficiently that when He comes again He comes emphatically as “*the Son of Man*,” *David’s Son*, and that His resurrection is represented as *a pattern* for that of His saints’, Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 4:14; 2 Cor. 4:14; Rom. 6:5; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2. 
	  (13) In the mortal, i.e. the part subject to death putting on immortality, 1 Cor. 15:52-3; Rom. 8:11. 
	  (14) In the effects of Paul’s preaching the doctrine on Athenians, etc., Acts 17:32; 26:6, 8, etc. 
	  (15) In the fact that if the body is not also redeemed, restored to its forfeited condition, then the Redemptive process is in so far incomplete. Such considerations, with especially the deeper and more significant one that the Davidic-Theocratic arrangement necessarily by covenant insists upon it, are amply sufficient to cause us to retain the old form of doctrine.
