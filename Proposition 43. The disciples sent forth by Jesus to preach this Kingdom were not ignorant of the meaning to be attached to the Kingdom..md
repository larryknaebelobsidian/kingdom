>To say that they were ignorant of that which they were *specially* to preach is an evident absurdity; and if true (which it is not) would severely reflect upon the Divine Teacher and Commissioner. Their mission necessarily implying *a correct knowledge* of the Kingdom, is confirmatory of Christ’s own preaching, for the preaching, of the Master and of those who are sent to preach *must correspond*.
>p. 274 Vol. 1 Prop. 43

### Jesus instructed, sent, never contradicted their views of the kingdom
>What Kingdom they all preached is so evident (e.g. from Acts 1:6, etc.), that our opponents save us the trouble of stating it by frankly admitting it (e.g. Prop. 42, Obs. 2). Jesus *instructed* them, Jesus *sent* them, Jesus *never contradicted* their views of the Kingdom, Jesus *approved* of their preaching and rejoiced over it. This is amply sufficient, seeing that the Kingdom accurately corresponded with the one contained in *the grammatical sense* of the covenant and prophecies.
> p. 274 Vol. 1 Prop. 43 Obs. 1

### Acts 1:6
So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?” - LSB

### Matthew 20:20,21
21 And He said to her, “What do you wish?” She said to Him, “Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right and one on Your left.” 22 But Jesus answered and said, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to Him, “We are able.” - LSB

### Luke 24:21
But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened. - LSB

### Jesus did not tell the Jews that they were in error respecting the kingdom
>Obs. 2. If Jesus did not tell the Jews and His disciples that they were *in error* respecting the Kingdom, and this already is presumptive evidence that they were correct in anticipating the Kingdom to be a restoration of the Davidic Kingdom, *much more* is this true, when He sends men, whom *He knows* to hold such a view, to *preach* it.
>p. 274 Vol. 1 Prop. 43 Obs. 2

>... the disciples preached the Jewish Kingdom,...
>p. 274 Vol. 1 Prop. 43 Obs. 2

>We therefore contend that, after Jesus Himself preached this Kingdom, taught His disciples *publicly and privately*, considered them *qualified* to proclaim the Kingdom, and *sent* them forth also to preach it—after all this, it is *sheer presumption* to question their knowledge of it.
>p. 275 Vol. 1 Prop. 43 Obs. 2

>If they were in error on so important and fundamental a point, it is unreasonable to suppose that Jesus would *leave* them in error, send them forth to *disseminate error*, and thus allow them, commissioned by Himself, *to deceive* the people.
>p. 275 Vol. 1 Prop. 43 Obs. 2
### The disciples preached the kingdom conditioned by repentance
>Obs. 3. It is freely admitted that there were many things that these disciples, when preaching the Kingdom, did not then know, but it was *not requisite* to know them for the simple reason that, *before the decided postponement of the Kingdom*, it was no part of their mission to preach them.
>...
>They were not to preach the death of Jesus, or things then unknown to them; they were commissioned to preach *the Kingdom* conditioned by repentance—to offer it to the Jewish nation—and *thus far* they were instructed and had knowledge of *the truth*.
>p. 276 Vol. 1 Prop. 43 Obs. 3
### Miracles attest to the truthfulness of the kingdom message
>Obs. 4. Miracles (Matt. 10:1, 8, Luke 10:17, etc.) attend their preaching of the Kingdom, which is *a most convincing attestation* of both the truthfulness of their proclamation, freed from error, and the intimate relationship that the Kingdom sustained to the Supernatural.
>p. 276 Vol. 1 Prop. 43 Obs. 4
### Misleading theories
>Obs. 7. Misled by some favorite theory, the plain facts of the disciples’ preaching are unintentionally misstated, and, of course, others are improperly influenced.
>p. 277 Vol. 1 Prop. 43 Obs. 7

>Obs. 8. It is a fact to be lamented, that while infidelity has made itself merry over the preaching of the disciples, calling it “mistaken,” “deceived,” “delusion,” etc., the Apologists, unable themselves to receive this preaching, or to satisfactorily account for it, have done nothing to remove this stumbling-block out of the way.
>p. 278 Vol. 1 Prop. 43 Obs. 8
### The church is awaiting for this Theocratic kingdom
>Why does the church, founded by these disciples, assume the position that Jesus, the crucified one, is the Messiah (with a full understanding of the Jewish meaning of the name), so declared by His resurrection and exaltation, who remains in heaven during this intermediate period until the elect are gathered out and the time arrives, *at the Sec. Advent*, for the reestablishment of the Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom?
