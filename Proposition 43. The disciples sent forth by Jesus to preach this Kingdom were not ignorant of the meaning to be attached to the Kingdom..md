>To say that they were ignorant of that which they were specially to preach is an evident absurdity; and if true (which it is not) would severely reflect upon the Divine Teacher and Commissioner. Their mission necessarily implying *a correct knowledge* of the Kingdom, is confirmatory of Christ’s own preaching, for the preaching, of the Master and of those who are sent to preach *must correspond*.
>p. 274 Vol. 1 Prop. 43

### Obs. 1

>What Kingdom they all preached is so evident (e.g. from Acts 1:6, etc.), that our opponents save us the trouble of stating it by frankly admitting it (e.g. Prop. 42, Obs. 2). Jesus *instructed* them, Jesus *sent* them, Jesus *never contradicted* their views of the Kingdom, Jesus *approved* of their preaching and rejoiced over it. This is amply sufficient, seeing that the Kingdom accurately corresponded with the one contained in *the grammatical sense* of the covenant and prophecies.
