# Proposition 64. The Kingdom being given to the elect only, any adoption into that elect portion must be revealed by express Divine Revelation.

### Props Mentioned
30 35

>No addition to, or continuation of, that elect portion to whom the Kingdom is alone promised (by way of inheritance), can be made *without direction from God Himself*.
>p. 408 Vol. 1 Prop 64
### "Keys of the kingdom"
>Obs. 1. It has already been shown (Prop. 30), how God, in order to vindicate His foreknowledge and purpose, revealed that Gentiles should participate in the blessings of the Kingdom. But *the manner* in which they should be introduced, was left unexplained. The indefinite nature of the predictions (as e.g. by Moses in Deut. 32) are now, in the light of fulfilment, become definite. But it was *not so* in the days of Jesus and His disciples; something was to be added to show how this incorporation could be effected, for with *the special election of the one* nation, it would have been presumptuous for any one to have joined others with it *without due authority* from God. Hence we find Jesus before His death promising the keys of the Kingdom of heaven to Peter, i.e. *the authoritative knowledge* by which that Kingdom could be gained. Owing to the excessive sinfulness of the nation in rejecting and killing the Messiah, *the one key* concerning the Jews (Acts 2:38), was given to Peter on the day of Pentecost, while *the other key* pertaining to the Gentiles was given to him later by special revelation (Acts 10:1-48).
>p. 408 Vol. 1 Prop 64 Obs. 1
### Jewish contention is evidence of Jewish expectation
>Obs. 2. This doctrine of the election of the Jewish nation, is one so clearly taught that it was deeply rooted in the minds of the Jews. The result was that no addition could be made to it or allowed without *an extraordinary* Divine revelation. Hence we read (Acts 11) that when “the apostles and brethren that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God,” they *contended* with Peter in consequence of his thus encouraging the Gentiles.
>p. 408-409 Vol. 1 Prop 64 Obs. 2
### "Too Jewish" accusation
>Obs. 3. Various authors of eminence have unjustly accused the apostles, and especially Peter, of being “*too Jewish*” in their views respecting the call of the Gentiles. But in the light of the covenants and the election, *how*, we ask, could they be otherwise?
>p. 409 Vol. 1 Prop 64 Obs. 3
### "A mystery"
>Obs. 4. The pronouncing, by Paul, of this election of Gentile believers as “*a mystery*,”—something, which, in view of the elected position of the Jews, was unexplained and to human reason inexplicable,—*confirms* our line of reasoning. That which made “the mystery,” was the sole and exclusive promise given to *the seed* of Abraham; the solving of “the mystery,” was the making known *how* the Gentiles could be incorporated *with* the elect nation.
>p. 410 Vol. 1 Prop 64 Obs. 4
### Jesus' words not understood before his death
>Obs. 5. Even the intimations given by Jesus, before his death, could not break in the minds of the disciples the force of this exclusive promise, until it was *also shown how* the Gentiles could become the seed of Abraham without observing the rites, etc., of a previously ordained proselytism.
