# Proposition 129. The Jewish view of a Pre-Mill, resurrection requisite for the introduction of the Messianic Kingdom is fully sustained by the grammatical sense of the New Testament.

### Props Mentioned
61-65

>Attention is thus prominently called to the fact, that the agreement existing between Jewish belief and the language of the New Test, most effectually supports our doctrinal position.
>p. 311 Vol. 2 Prop. 129
### View consistent with Bible
>Obs. 1. To avoid repeating, the reader is requested to notice how under the preceding Props, relating to the res. taught in the Old Test., the Apoc., and the Gospels and Epistles, the constant reference was made to *the Jewish belief* prevailing, and quotations were given fully sustaining the same from critics, historians, commentators, etc. Now, we ask the reader to consider how it was possible for Jesus and the inspired writers to employ language, *in view of such an existing belief*, fully corroborating it, unless the belief was *a correct one*, in strict accord with the Divine Purpose.
>p. 311 Vol. 2 Prop. 129 Obs. 1 
### View claimed "antiquated", "Jewish" by some
>Obs. 2. Again, there is no question concerning the grammatical sense, for that is admitted even by our opponents, many of whom we have quoted. But we are assured that that sense is not the one intended; that a typical or spiritual meaning is the one to be received. Hence the doctrine of a literal Pre-Mill. res. is derided as “antiquated,” “Jewish,” etc., and utterly unfitted for the advanced thought of the age.
>p. 311 Vol. 2 Prop. 129 Obs. 2
### Infidel objection claiming superstition and ignorance
>Obs. 3. Infidels object to the New Test, on the ground that it unmistakably teaches this *previous existing Jewish view* (so Strauss, Bauer, Renan, etc.), and reject the whole as evidence of superstition and ignorance.
>p. 312 Vol. 2 Prop. 129 Obs. 3 
### Resurrection opinions of Jews
>Obs. 4. Judge Jones (Notes, p. 284) remarks of the Jewish opinion: “They understood that the promises (in covenants) which God made to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob were absolute; and they believed that He would surely perform them, even to those of former generations, who had part in them; and on this ground, mainly, they taught the resurrection of the dead, Acts 24:15.” 
>
>“Three opinions touching the res. prevailed to a greater or less extent among the Jews. 
>1. (1) Some maintained that only the just or righteous of their nation would be raised; 
>2. (2) others maintained that the whole of their race (all Israelites) would be raised; 
>3. (3) and some maintained that all Israelites and *some* Gentiles would be raised. 
>
>It is evident from Acts 24:14, 15, that the Jews of Paul’s day did not adopt the first of these opinions, but they appear to have *limited* the res. to their nation. In Rom. 9:2-5, Paul teaches that *the adoption*, by which he meant *the resurrection*, Rom. 8:23, pertained to Israelites; and hence it would seem that the res., as a term of the original covenant, was *limited* to Israel.

>Rabbi Bechai says, God granted four special honors to Israel, viz., 
>1. (1) the land of Canaan; 
>2. (2) the law; 
>3. (3) prophecy; 
>4. (4) the resurrection of the dead. Josephus, though obscure, evidently did not believe the res. would be universal.”
