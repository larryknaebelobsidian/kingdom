### What is the Church?
>Obs. 1. The Christian Church is an association of believers in Christ, who, led by the same consciousness of God, truth and spirit, accept of the terms of salvation, repentance and faith, and continue in the use of the means of grace appointed by the Redeemer. It is an association exclusively for religious purposes, separate and distinct from civil or secular interests.
>p. 609 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 1
### Why the Church formed?
>It (the church) was formed solely on account of the rejection of the Kingdom by the Jews, in order that through it a body of believers might be raised, through whom finally, when all gathered, the Kingdom might be reorganized in the most effective and triumphant manner.
>p. 609 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 1
### Early church did not believe they were the kingdom
>Obs. 2. The first churches and the apostolic Fathers and their immediate successors, as already shown had *no conception* of the Church being the promised Kingdom of the Covenant and Prophets. They looked and prayed for its speedy coming at the Second Advent. Origen was the first one who made the Church the mystic Kingdom of God (see p. 112, *Voice of the Church*, by Taylor).
>p. 610-611 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 2
### Reasons why church is not the kingdom
>(1) *The announcements* of the Kingdom with which the New Test, begins is opposed to it, Prop. 19; 
>(2) *the expectations* of the pious Jews, Props. 20, 47, 40, 41, and 43; 
>(3) *the condition* of the Church does not accord with predictions of the Prophets respecting the Kingdom, Prop. 21; 
>(4) the Church does *not correspond* with the preaching of John, Jesus and the disciples, Props. 22, 23, 38, 39, 54, 42, 44; 
>(5) the Church is not like the Kingdom of God once established, *lacking* the Theocratic arrangement once instituted, Props. 25, 27, 28, 29; 
>(6) the Church is not like the Kingdom once established, *overthrown and promised a restoration*, Props. 31, 32, 33; 
>(7) the Church is not the Kingdom, otherwise the disciples were *ignorant* of what they preached, Prop. 43; 
>(8) that the Church is the promised Kingdom is opposed *by the covenants*, Props. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52; 
>(9) the preaching of the Kingdom as nigh and then its *postponement* is against making the Church a Kingdom, Props. 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, etc.; 
>(10) the preaching of the apostles after Christ’s death *confirms* our doctrine, Props. 70, 71, 72, 73, etc.; 
>(11) the Church was *not taken* from the Jews but the Kingdom was, Prop, preceding, etc.; 
>(12) the Church is not the Kingdom because it will not be given *until* the elect are gathered, Props. 62, 63, 65, 68, etc.; 
>(13) *The Second Advent* is the period when the Kingdom is established, Prop. 51, 52.
>p. 612 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 3
### Continuous kingdom view
>Obs. 4. Some occupying higher ground, take the view that the Kingdom of God existed continuously before and in the Christian Church, asserting that the form of the Theocracy was changeable and temporary (so Kurtz, *His. of the Old Covenant*, p. no), but that the essence was retained and transferred to the Christian Church, thus forming an unbroken Kingdom of God.
>p. 613 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 4
### The present used as the future
>Obs. 6. A main leading feature in this effort to make out of the Church the predicted Kingdom of the Messiah; is found in applying to the present, things relating to the Church which are spoken of *as prospectively* (the present used as the future, Prop. 65, Obs. 9), as e.g. Heb. 12:22, 23. Promises are given which can only, as we shall hereafter show, be realized by the Church as *a completed body.*
>p. 615 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 6
### Mis-appropriated promises
>... many promises, that are *only to be realized in the future* Kingdom, are seized and appropriated to the Church; and this is not only done by the Popes quoting and applying to themselves, as earthly Heads of the Church, Millennial predictions, but by Protestants in their laudation of Churches.
>p. 615 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 6
### Mis-used names
>It is notorious that the names Israel, Judah, and Jerusalem are regarded by a host of writers as synonymous with the Church, without *any regard to the connection* of the prophecy that the same Israel, Judah and Jerusalem acted and overthrown for its sinfulness, is to be restored to favor, and is thus meant.
>p. 615 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 6
### Favorite passage used
>... Isa. 9:6, 7 is the favorite passage with them in making the Church the Kingdom of the Messiah.
>p. 616 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 7
### Church is a state of probation
>Obs. 9. The church, as we have shown, being designed to gather out and raise up those who should be rulers in, inheritors of the Kingdom, it is necessary for them to possess certain qualifications. Those just mentioned are specified, and therefore true believers, instead of being *in* the Kingdom, are represented as being *in a state* of probation, of trial and testing. The very nature of probation *is opposed* to the idea of the Kingdom as given by the Prophets, and hence in the Epistles believers are exhorted to hold fast to faith and obedience that they *might attain unto* the Kingdom, 1 Pet. 1:7; 2 Thess. 1:5-11, etc.
>p. 617 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 9
### The Church is struggling and suffering 
>Obs. 10. The church, instead of being represented as a Kingdom, is held up to us as *a struggling, suffering people*, Col. 1:24; 2 Tim. 1:8; 2 Cor. 1:5; 2 Thess. 1:4; 2 Pet. 4:12,13, etc.
>p. 617 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 10
### Missing modern phrases
>Obs. 11. Those modern phrases of ministers and people, “of extending, enlarging, building up, etc., *Christ’s Kingdom*” are *not to be found* in the New. Test. They are the result of viewing the church as the Kingdom. The absence of such phraseology and eulogies of the church derived from Millennial descriptions must also have some weight with the student.
>p. 618 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 11
### Church did not begin in period of suffering
>Obs. 12. The church is not this Kingdom of prophecy, because the establishment of the church does *not meet the conditions* of the prophecy respecting the period of suffering, etc., preceding the Kingdom.
>p. 618 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 12
### No agreement on when the Church-Kingdom began
>Obs. 14. Those who believe that the church is the Kingdom, differ widely among themselves as to *when* it was established and in *what* it consists.
>p. 619 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 14
### Bad hermeneutics
>Obs. 15. Making the church the Kingdom of God is *a plain violation* of some important rules of interpretation.
>p. 620 Vol. 1 Prop. 93 Obs. 15
