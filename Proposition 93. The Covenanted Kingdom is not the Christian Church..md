### What is the church?
>Obs. 1. The Christian Church is an association of believers in Christ, who, led by the same consciousness of God, truth and spirit, accept of the terms of salvation, repentance and faith, and continue in the use of the means of grace appointed by the Redeemer. It is an association exclusively for religious purposes, separate and distinct from civil or secular interests.

### Why Church formed?
>It (the church) was formed solely on account of the rejection of the Kingdom by the Jews, in order that through it a body of believers might be raised, through whom finally, when all gathered, the Kingdom might be reorganized in the most effective and triumphant manner.
>Obs. 1

### Early church did not believe they were the kingdom
>Obs. 2. The first churches and the apostolic Fathers and their immediate successors, as already shown had no conception of the Church being the promised Kingdom of the Covenant and Prophets. They looked and prayed for its speedy coming at the Second Advent. Origen was the first one who made the Church the mystic Kingdom of God

### Reasons why church is not the kingdom
>1. (1) The announcements of the Kingdom with which the New Test, begins is opposed to it, Prop. 19; 
>2. (2) the expectations of the pious Jews, Props. 20, 47, 40, 41, and 43; 
>3. (3) the condition of the Church does not accord with predictions of the Prophets respecting the Kingdom, Prop. 21; 
>4. (4) the Church does not correspond with the preaching of John, Jesus and the disciples, Props. 22, 23, 38, 39, 54, 42, 44; 
>5. (5) the Church is not like the Kingdom of God once established, lacking the Theocratic arrangement once instituted, Props. 25, 27, 28, 29; 
>6. (6) the Church is not like the Kingdom once established, overthrown and promised a restoration, Props. 31, 32, 33; 
>7. (7) the Church is not the Kingdom, otherwise the disciples were ignorant of what they preached, Prop. 43; 
>8. (8) that the Church is the promised Kingdom is opposed by the covenants, Props. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52; 
>9. (9) the preaching of the Kingdom as nigh and then its postponement is against making the Church a Kingdom, Props. 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, etc.; 
>10. (10) the preaching of the apostles after Christ’s death confirms our doctrine, Props. 70, 71, 72, 73, etc.; 
>11. (11) the Church was not taken from the Jews but the Kingdom was, Prop, preceding, etc.; 
>12. (12) the Church is not the Kingdom because it will not be given until the elect are gathered, Props. 62, 63, 65, 68, etc.; 
>13. (13) The Second Advent is the period when the Kingdom is established, Prop. 51, 52.
>Obs. 3
### Continuous kingdom view
>Obs. 4. Some occupying higher ground, take the view that the Kingdom of God existed continuously before and in the Christian Church, asserting that the form of the Theocracy was changeable and temporary (so Kurtz, His. of the Old Covenant, p. no), but that the essence was retained and transferred to the Christian Church, thus forming an unbroken Kingdom of God.
### The present used as the future
>Obs. 6. A main leading feature in this effort to make out of the Church the predicted Kingdom of the Messiah; is found in applying to the present, things relating to the Church which are spoken of as prospectively (the present used as the future, Prop. 65, Obs. 9), as e.g. Heb. 12:22, 23.
### Mis-appropriated promises
>many promises, that are only to be realized in the future Kingdom, are seized and appropriated to the Church; and this is not only done by the Popes quoting and applying to themselves, as earthly Heads of the Church, Millennial predictions, but by Protestants in their laudation of Churches.
### Mis-used names
>It is notorious that the names Israel, Judah, and Jerusalem are regarded by a host of writers as synonymous with the Church, without any regard to the connection of the prophecy that the same Israel, Judah and Jerusalem acted and overthrown for its sinfulness, is to be restored to favor, and is thus meant.

### Favorite passage used
>Isa. 9:6, 7 is the favorite passage with them in making the Church the Kingdom of the Messiah.

### Church is a state of probation
>Obs. 9. The church, as we have shown, being designed to gather out and raise up those who should be rulers in, inheritors of the Kingdom, it is necessary for them to possess certain qualifications. Those just mentioned are specified, and therefore true believers, instead of being in the Kingdom, are represented as being in a state of probation, of trial and testing. The very nature of probation is opposed to the idea of the Kingdom as given by the Prophets, and hence in the Epistles believers are exhorted to hold fast to faith and obedience that they might attain unto the Kingdom, 1 Pet. 1:7; 2 Thess. 1:5-11, etc.

### The Church is struggling and suffering 
>Obs. 10. The church, instead of being represented as a Kingdom, is held up to us as a struggling, suffering people, Col. 1:24; 2 Tim. 1:8; 2 Cor. 1:5; 2 Thess. 1:4; 2 Pet. 4:12,13, etc.

### Missing modern phrases
>Obs. 11. Those modern phrases of ministers and people, “of extending, enlarging, building up, etc., Christ’s Kingdom” are not to be found in the New. Test. They are the result of viewing the church as the Kingdom. The absence of such phraseology and eulogies of the church derived from Millennial descriptions must also have some weight with the student.

### Church did not begin in period of suffering
>Obs. 12. The church is not this Kingdom of prophecy, because the establishment of the church does not meet the conditions of the prophecy respecting the period of suffering, etc., preceding the Kingdom.

### No agreement on when the Church-Kingdom began
>Obs. 14. Those who believe that the church is the Kingdom, differ widely among themselves as to when it was established and in what it consists.

### Bad hermeneutics
>Obs. 15. Making the church the Kingdom of God is a plain violation of some important rules of interpretation.
