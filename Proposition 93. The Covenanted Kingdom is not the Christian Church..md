>Obs. 1. The Christian Church is an association of believers in Christ, who, led by the same consciousness of God, truth and spirit, accept of the terms of salvation, repentance and faith, and continue in the use of the means of grace appointed by the Redeemer. It is an association exclusively for religious purposes, separate and distinct from civil or secular interests.


>It (the church) was formed solely on account of the rejection of the Kingdom by the Jews, in order that through it a body of believers might be raised, through whom finally, when all gathered, the Kingdom might be reorganized in the most effective and triumphant manner.
>Obs. 1

>Obs. 2. The first churches and the apostolic Fathers and their immediate successors, as already shown had no conception of the Church being the promised Kingdom of the Covenant and Prophets. They looked and prayed for its speedy coming at the Second Advent. Origen was the first one who made the Church the mystic Kingdom of God

>13. (13) The Second Advent is the period when the Kingdom is established, Prop. 51, 52.
>Obs. 3

>Obs. 4. Some occupying higher ground, take the view that the Kingdom of God existed continuously before and in the Christian Church, asserting that the form of the Theocracy was changeable and temporary (so Kurtz, His. of the Old Covenant, p. no), but that the essence was retained and transferred to the Christian Church, thus forming an unbroken Kingdom of God.
