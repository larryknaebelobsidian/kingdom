>This cannot be otherwise, *owing to their incorporation* with *the elect* Jewish nation as *the seed* of Abraham by virtue of their faith in, and union with, Christ. To keep up *this elect* the Gentiles are engrafted, engrafted, and hence are called, on account of their identification with the elected people of God, “*the elect according to the fore-knowledge of God*” (1 Pet, 1:1, 2), “*a chosen generation*” (2:9, 10) “*which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God*” (comp. Eph. 1; 1 Thess. 1:4; Col. 3:12; Rom. 9, etc.). If we take the language and promises applied to this elect people, they are *identical* with those originally given to the line of election,, and summed up in the expressions “*a royal priesthood, a holy nation*,” etc. (comp. Ex. 19:5, 6; Deut. 10:15, etc.). .

>The term “*elect*” is need with reference to their being “*chosen*” for this kingdom. 2 Pet. 1:10 exhorts brethren “*to make your calling and election sure*,” and adds that by so doing they shall enter “*the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ*.” *How make it sure*? 
>(1) The Jews are elect (Prop. 24, etc.); 
>(2) since their national fall (as a punishment for sin) the Gentiles are invited to become, by faith, the seed of Abraham that shall inherit the promises; 
>(3) by thus becoming the seed of Abraham *they enter into the covenanted line and also become the elect*; 
>(4) it is by *faith in Christ*, in whom as the predicted David’s Son are centered “*exceeding great and precious promises*,” that they become the elect; 
>(5) hence, to make our call as Gentiles to become children of Abraham, and our election to the promised Kingdom sure, *we must live a life of faith in Christ*. In the very nature of the case, the foreknowledge of God is thus manifested “*having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ*” (Eph. 1:5) in order that the covenanted inheritance may be obtained by “*the elect of God*” (Col. 3:12; James 2:5, etc.).

>Before God took the Israelites to Canaan He first provided *a sufficient number* of people, even under great trial and sorrow, who should be able to occupy the land, drive out their adversaries, and enjoy their imparted possession. So *now* God has promised a rich inheritance, even the whole earth, to the saints under a Theocratic ordering, which they are to realize in a peculiar, exalted way; but before this inheritance is given God is engaged *in gathering out* this people, even under trial, temptation, and tribulation; and when the chosen, elected number *is complete* (known only to Him), *then* the possession will be received, the adversaries will be judged and overthrown by them as associated in Rulership with the Lord Christ.

>. . . it includes Gentile believers who are *incorporated* as Jews, and to whom, as we shall hereafter show, the kingdom is *an especial* manner given.  We know of no "Gentile Christians" separate and distinct from the Jewish election and hence Daniel is correct in speaking of the saints relating to the future, without the least intimation of a change from the Jewish to a Gentile standpoint.

>This doctrine of the Kingdom in its covenanted aspect gives us the key to the doctrine of election. The language referring to election is based 
>(1) on the Divine Purpose relating to this Theocratic Kingdom; 
>(2) on the Plan embraced in that Purpose, of gathering out a people,—whose character, etc., is predetermined—to whom it can be entrusted; 
>(3) on the acceptance of the conditions by persons through which they come into the line of that purpose. The election then (a) is, *so far as God* is concerned, pre-ordained; such a people *will be gathered* (as even Moses predicted) for such a Kingdom of kings and priests to be established, and, as *God changes not*, it will most assuredly be carried into execution; (b) on the part of man, he comes in the line of the predestinated order, or elect, or chosen, *just so soon* as he accords or falls in with the determined process of engrafting through faith in Jesus Christ.

>The believing Gentile, becoming through his faith a “Jew inwardly,” is elected or chosen in the place of “the children of the Kingdom” (Matt. 8:11.12), who, through unbelief, are cut off from the nationally covenanted Kingdom. Therefore, these chosen ones, becoming such through adoption, “*shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob* (to whom the covenant was given) *in the Kingdom of heaven*,” etc.
