### Bible teaches a literal, earthly kingdom
>Obs. 1. The Bible emphatically teaches, in its Millennial descriptions, a Kingdom here on the earth over man in the flesh, which shall exhibit in a striking administration the principles, laws, results, etc., of a government beyond all others, and adapted in every respect to meet all the requisites to secure stability, happiness, etc. (comp. e.g. Isa. chs. 60, 54, 61, etc.).
>...
>On the other hand, reject these things, confine the Kingdom to the Church, limit the reign of the Son of Man to Heaven, etc., and you have not, and cannot receive, such a visible, outward universal Kingdom or dominion, in all respects perfectly adapted to the civil as well as the religions wants of humanity, as the Word of God tells us—if we take its plain grammatical sense—to anticipate.
### God uses preparation over time
>Obs. 2. God, in view of the conditions of nature, and to exemplify his own power in constant impressions upon man, etc., does not produce the perfect fruit at once; His method of procedure, as seen in nature and in grace, embraces an ascending scale, the reaching of an intended goal by preparatory processes and means.
### Satisfied cravings of humanity
>Obs. 3. The reign of this Son of Man strictly in accordance with the covenant, and the union of the saints with Him in such a rule, will alone satisfy the cravings of humanity for a strong and most blessed government, which shall break down forever the opposing, clashing interests of nations, dispel their jealousies, and unite them, freed from evils, under one common, visible, and accessible Head.
### Christ developing Himself in humanity
>Obs. 4. Accepting the phraseology of Ullman, Neander, and others, that “Christianity is Christ developing Himself in humanity,” we add—to perfect the idea—for the purpose of its future visible manifestation in Him and His saints in behalf of the race in an exhibited perfect government, the highest and most honorable position in which it can be placed.
