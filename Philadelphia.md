### The Judge
He who 
- is holy
- is true
- has the key of David
- opens and no one will shut
- shuts and no one opens

### The Consideration
I know your deeds
I have put before you an  open door which no one can shut
You have
- a little power
- kept My word
- not denied My name

### Penalty
To those who are of the synagogue of Satan, I will make them come down and bow at your feet and make them know that I have loved you


### Call to Action
Hold fast to what you have (since I am coming quickly)
- so no one will take your crown
### Reward
I will keep you from the hour of testing (about to come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth)
He who overcomes
- I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God
- he will not go out from it anymore
- Judge will write on him 
	- the name of His God, 
	- the name of the city of His God (new Jerusalem), 
	- His new name
