>Jesus, in teaching His disciples to pray for a future, coming Kingdom, undoubtedly taught them to pray for *the same* Kingdom covenanted, predicted, and which they preached. He certainly desired them to pray understandingly, and, therefore, the views entertained by them respecting the Kingdom remaining uncontradicted to the end (Acts 1:6), and which must have inspired the use of the petition, are certainly correct (comp. Props. 37-45, and 54-68).

>The petition “Thy Kingdom come” (Matt 6:10, Luke 11:2) cannot appropriately be prayed by one who is already *in* the Kingdom, for the sentiment expressed looks to futurity. The disciples to whom it was given, and evidently used it, had no idea whatever of the modern notions engrafted on the prayer. They prayed it looking, as we have in detail proven (as many of our opponents frankly admit), for a Kingdom to come visibly in the future, and this Kingdom was the Theocratic-Davidic restored under the Messiah.

>The petition “*Thy Kingdom come*” is a prayer that *one* distinctive Kingdom should come, not two or more; not that one should be within the other, not that one should be a prelude to the other. The disciples only recognized in the petition one Kingdom; the early Church adopted the same belief, and we see no reason for a change of faith, seeing that the covenanted and predicted Messianic Kingdom, as expressed in the plain grammatical sense, is the one evidently denoted.

>The petition “*Thy Kingdom come*” assumes, by its allusion to futurity, that the Kingdom did not then exist.
