# Proposition 105. The Lord’s Prayer is indicative of the fact that the Church is not the covenanted Messianic Kingdom.

>Jesus, in teaching His disciples to pray for a future, coming Kingdom, undoubtedly taught them to pray for *the same* Kingdom covenanted, predicted, and which they preached. He certainly desired them to pray understandingly, and, therefore, the views entertained by them respecting the Kingdom remaining uncontradicted to the end (Acts 1:6), and which must have inspired the use of the petition, are certainly correct (comp. Props. 37-45, and 54-68).
>p. 689 Vol. 1 Prop 105 

>The petition “Thy Kingdom come” (Matt 6:10, Luke 11:2) cannot appropriately be prayed by one who is already *in* the Kingdom, for the sentiment expressed looks to futurity. The disciples to whom it was given, and evidently used it, had no idea whatever of the modern notions engrafted on the prayer. They prayed it looking, as we have in detail proven (as many of our opponents frankly admit), for a Kingdom to come visibly in the future, and this Kingdom was the Theocratic-Davidic restored under the Messiah. We may well ask. How could the Divine Master give them a prayer with such a clause in, which, as all the facts show, they —if the modern view is correct—grossly misunderstood, without some explanation? Our line of argument conclusively proves that such an explanation was unnecessary (and hence was not given) because they had the true idea of the Kingdom, when they prayed for the Theocratic Kingdom to come. Jesus, knowing the view of the Kingdom held, by giving this petition in its present form, endorses the disciples’ opinion as a correct one.
>p. 689 Vol. 1 Prop 105 Obs. 1

### [Matthew 6:9-13](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=matt+6%3A9-13)
Pray, then, in this way:
‘Our Father who is in heaven,
Hallowed be Your name.
10 Your kingdom come.
Your will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven.
11 Give us this day our daily bread.
12 And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
13 And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. 
\[For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.’\]

### [Luke 11:2-4](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=luke+11%3A2-4)
And He said to them, “When you pray, say:
‘Father, hallowed be Your name.
Your kingdom come.
3 Give us each day our daily bread.
4 And forgive us our sins,
For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
And lead us not into temptation.’”


>The petition “*Thy Kingdom come*” is a prayer that *one* distinctive Kingdom should come, not two or more; not that one should be within the other, not that one should be a prelude to the other. The disciples only recognized in the petition one Kingdom; the early Church adopted the same belief, and we see no reason for a change of faith, seeing that the covenanted and predicted Messianic Kingdom, as expressed in the plain grammatical sense, is the one evidently denoted.
>p. 690 Vol. 1 Prop 105 Obs. 2

>Obs. 3. Attention is directed to the fact that critics (like Lightfoot, Schoetgen, Gregory, etc.), indorsed by various commentators, assert that Jesus collected this prayer out of Jewish Eschatologies, and prove the assertion by given every sentiment expressed in full as drawn from them.

>Obs. 4. The quite early Church entertained our view of this petition, as is apparent from the Eschatology affirmed by them, seeing that they looked for the speedy Advent, etc.

>The petition “*Thy Kingdom come*” assumes, by its allusion to futurity, that the Kingdom did not then exist.
>p. 691 Vol. 1 Prop 105 Obs. 5

>Obs. 6. The expression “Thy Kingdom corns” expresses faith in the realization of the covenant, and the predictions based upon it.

>Obs. 7. “Thy Kingdom come” embraces the idea of a conspicuous, visible, external coming, so that every one would be cognizant of its coming.

>Obs. 8. Prophecy, if the Church is the Kingdom prayed for, should, by way of encouragement, and in answer to faith, show that the prayer is realized in its delineation of events. But the reverse of this is true,

>Obs. 9. This petition must be, if Scripture is to give in its whole testimony, viewed in the light of the postponement of the Kingdom (comp. Props. 58, 66, 67, etc.).

>Obs. 10. Eminent divines take this petition, and in dedication and missionary sermons, employ it to denote the present existing Church, and vigorously and eloquently exhort their hearers or readers to help, by special labor and efforts, to make the Kingdom come.

>Obs. 11. “Thy Kingdom come” is the prayer of those who are “heirs” for they have an interest in it.

>It is a prayer designed to stimulate faith and hope, to wean from the world, to qualify us for a future “abundant entrance.”

>To appreciate it properly, we must study its distinctive meaning, denoting as it does a well-defined (“Thy”) Kingdom, which the Father has promised most solemnly under oath, and which David’s Son receives from the Ancient of Days at the allotted period—a Kingdom bringing completed Redemption and the most precious blessings.

>Obs. 12. Pre-Millenarians are a unit in the application of this petition to a future Messianic Kingdom at the Sec. Advent.

>Therefore all Pre-Millenarians unite in regarding the petition as embracing that still future Kingdom.
