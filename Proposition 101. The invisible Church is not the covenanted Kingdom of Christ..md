# Proposition 101. The invisible Church is not the covenanted Kingdom of Christ.
### A new teaching since the reformation
>This division of the church into the visible and invisible is of comparative recent origin. Dr. Knapp (Ch. Theol., p. 471) traces the use of these terms, saying: “These are, indeed, new, and bare come into use since the Reformation.”
>p. 655 Vol. 1 Prop 101 Obs. 1

### Unknown to the early church
>The doctrine that the invisible church is the Kingdom of God was unknown to the early church.
>p. 658 Vol. 1 Prop 101 Obs. 3
### Inconsistent sophistry
>Obs. 4. It is remarkable to notice how, in the advocacy of the invisible church as a Kingdom, its advocates involve themselves in a sophistry in-consistent with their own development theory of a growth of this invisible Kingdom until finally at some time in the future it shall become visible as a world dominion, etc.
### Misinterpretation of some passages
>Obs. 5. This adhesion to an invisible Kingdom is based on the supposed ground, that according to some passages we are taught that Christ will not have an earthly Kingdom.
>...
>every reader can for himself see the utter antagonism of their spiritual theories by comparing their utterances on the texts “my Kingdom is not of this world” (John 18:36), “the Kingdom of God is within you” (Luke 17:21), with those derived from Dan. 2:34, 35, 44, 45; Dan. 7:14, 27, and Heb. 11:15.

### Example of vagueness
Obs. 6
### Some unbelievers hold to this
>Obs. 7. It is certainly curious to notice how even unbelievers avail themselves of this invisible Kingdom theory.
