### Props Mentioned
4 9 10 79 80 84 85 100 108 109 110 175
### A new teaching since the reformation
>This division of the church into the visible and invisible is of comparative recent origin. Dr. Knapp (*Ch. Theol.*, p. 471) traces the use of these terms, saying: “These are, indeed, *new*, and bare come into use since the Reformation.”
>p. 655 Vol. 1 Prop 101 Obs. 1
### Unknown to the early church
>The doctrine that the invisible church is the Kingdom of God was unknown to the early church.
>p. 658 Vol. 1 Prop 101 Obs. 3
### Inconsistent sophistry
>Obs. 4. It is remarkable to notice how, in the advocacy of the invisible church as a Kingdom, its advocates involve themselves in a sophistry *inconsistent* with their own development theory of a growth of this invisible Kingdom until finally at some time in the future it shall become visible as a world dominion, etc.
>p. 659 Vol. 1 Prop 101 Obs. 4
### Misinterpretation of some passages
>Obs. 5. This adhesion to an invisible Kingdom is based on the supposed ground, that according to some passages we are taught that Christ will not have an earthly Kingdom.
>...
>every reader can for himself see *the utter antagonism* of their spiritual theories by comparing their utterances on the texts “my Kingdom is not of this world” (John 18:36), “the Kingdom of God is within you” (Luke 17:21), *with those* derived from Dan. 2:34, 35, 44, 45; Dan. 7:14, 27, and Rev. 11:15.
>p. 660 Vol. 1 Prop 101 Obs. 5
### Example of vagueness
p. 660 Vol. 1 Prop 101 Obs. 6
### Some unbelievers hold to this
>Obs. 7. It is certainly curious to notice how even unbelievers avail themselves of this invisible Kingdom theory.
>p. 661 Vol. 1 Prop 101 Obs. 7
