### Preliminary considerations
>The preservation of the people is distinctly predicted, not in the possession of king, government, etc., characteristic of a nation properly organized but, in a dispersed and utterly disorganized condition, retaining national peculiarities, such as rites, practices, customs, doctrines, etc.
>Obs. 1

>The same nation which experienced this heavy tribulation is also to realize the blessings of restoration. There is nothing so sad and absurd in the interpretation of the Bible as that, alas! so prevalent with many, to give all the threatening, curses, and afflictions to the Jews, and appropriate the promises and blessings to the Gentiles or to the Church.
>Obs. 1


>1. (1) that certain prophecies have never, in any sense, been fulfilled, as Ezek. chs. 36, 39, etc.; Isa. 11:11, 12, etc.; 
>2. (2) that the promises of Deut, and Lev. cannot be explained in any other way than referring to the Jewish nation; 
>3. (3) that the prophecies referring to restoration distinguish between Judah and Israel; 
>4. (4) that the division into “two kingdoms,” formerly existing, is stated and the union into “one nation” in the same land predicted; 
>5. (5) Jerusalem and the Jewish nation are in the restoration distinguished from the Gentiles; 
>6. (6) the action, position, etc., assigned to the Jewish nation at and after the restoration; 
>7. (7) the prosperity and the results of the restoration point to the future; 
>8. (8) the astounding reception and acknowledgment of the crucified Saviour by the nation, which can only be predicted of the personal interview described by the prophets; 
>9. (9) the refining process, terrible but glorious.
>Obs. 1

### Predicted Restoration is not the return from Babylon
>Obs. 2. It is requisite here to meet another objection urged against our view, on the ground that the predictions of restoration were met by the return from Babylon.

>It is amazing that believers in Holy Writ can overlook the fact that not only prophets before, but prophets at and after, the return from Babylon predict the same glorious restoration. restoration. Let any one e.g. compare Zechariah, Haggai, Malachi, with previous prophets and a restoration very different from the one experienced is seen to be foretold.
>Obs. 2

#### Zech. 12:1-4
>1. (1) the multitude gathered against Jerusalem besieging it; 
>2. (2) the Lord interfering in behalf of the people; 
>3. (3) Jerusalem becomes “a cup of trembling” “a burdensome stone” to the nations; 
>4. (4) the complete overthrow of all enemies; 
>5. (5) the subsequent exaltation of “the house of David” etc.


#### Zech. 14
>1. (1) the smiting of the Shepherd, 
>2. (2) the scattering of the sheep, 
>3. (3) a period of tribulation, 
>4. (4) the gathering of nations against Jerusalem, 
>5. (4) the Lord interfering, “his feet standing upon the mount of Olives” 
>6. (5) the saints coming with Him, 
>7. (6) the destruction of the enemies, 
>8. (7) the reign of Christ, 
>9. (8) Jerusalem safely inhabited, exalted, etc.

#### Joel 3
>1. (1) the same gathering of nations, 
>2. (2) deliverance by the Lord and His “mighty ones,” 
>3. (3) the complete removal of all enemies, 
>4. (4) the Lord dwelling in the holy mountain, 
>5. (5) the safety, happiness, etc., of Jerusalem.

#### Ezek. 38-39
>1. (1) a confederation of nations is formed against Jerusalem, 
>2. (2) the Lord will directly interfere for the land of Israel and His people, 
>3. (3) a terrible overthrow of those nations, 
>4. (4) the cessation of captivity and gathering of the Jews “out of their enemies’ lands” “unto their own land,” etc.


#### Jer. 30:4-11
>1. (1) a time of dire trouble, 
>2. (2) deliverance, 
>3. (3) the nation “shall return from the land of their captivity” 
>4. (4) and in that time “they shall serve the Lord their God and David their king.”


>Hence, the conclusion must be formed that the nation has not yet experienced its full tribulation, and that until all is fulfilled respecting them the restoration bestowed directly by God (not by a nation, as may, and in all probability will, partially be done), cannot possibly be effected.


#### Isa. 11:10-16
#### Ezek. 36:8-38
>1. (1) the gathering out of all countries and the bringing again into their own land; 
>2. (2) they shall dwell in the land given to their fathers; 
>3. (3) they shall be also converted; 
>4. (4) the desolate land is to be tilled and sown; 
>5. (5) man and beast are to be multiplied on it; 
>6. (6) the cities shall again be inherited and the wastes builded; 
>7. (7) they shall be settled after their “old estates
>8. (8) God “will do better unto you than at your beginnings”; 
>9. (9) the land shall be for an inheritance; 
>10. (10) the land shall no more be bereaved; 
>11. (11) it shall not be burdened with the shame of the heathen; 
>12. (12) the identical land defiled by Israel’s sins is the one thus again obtained; 
>13. (13) the removal from the land caused by sin; 
>14. (14) the return to it caused by God’s mercy and faithfulness; 
>15. (15) the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field so sure as to prevent famine; 
>16. (17) the land once desolate to become like the Garden of Eden; 
>17. (18) the heathen that are left shall acknowledge the Lord’s power when this is done; 
>18. (19) the house of Israel shall be increased with flocks of men and the waste cities with the same.

#### Ezek. 37
>After describing the resurrection which (as shown Prop. 126) is also related to this period, he tells us 
>1. (1) that the children of Israel shall be gathered from among the heathen and be brought into their own land; 
>2. (2) that they shall be “one nation” and not “two kingdoms” as of old; 
>3. (3) that they shall have “one king” even “David my servant”; 
>4. (4) that they shall no more be 64 defiled” being “cleansed”; 
>5. (5) that “they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt”; 
>6. (6) that they and their descendants “shall dwell in it forever” (for the ages, so some); 
>7. (7) that during these ages, or forever, David shall be their Prince; 
>8. (8) that they shall have peace and be multiplied; 
>9. (9) that God’s sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forever; 
>10. (10) that their situation shall be as in Rev. 21:3; 
>11. (11) that the Gentiles shall acknowledge the great power of God when this is accomplished.

#### Jer. 32:37-44

#### Jer. 3:14-18

#### Ezek. 11:16-20

#### Jer. 23:5-8

#### Ezek. 34:11-31

>Zeph. 3:8-20; Zech. 8; Jer. 31; Micah, chs. 4, 5, and 8; Hos. 2:14, etc; Isa. 43 and 52, etc. Bp. Newton well remarked, “innumerable are the prophecies concerning the conversion and restoration of this people”;

>If the reason be asked why, although not ignored but expressly mentioned and implied, comparatively so little is stated on the subject in the New Test, the answer is given by Jesus and the Apostles themselves, viz., that the prophets are to be fulfilled, and that it is taken for granted that we possess, read, study and believe in them.

### Where are the 10 tribes?
>Obs. 5. There is only one objection that at first thought appears plausible urged against this restoration, which we feel unable to answer as it probably deserves. It is this: “the whole house of Israel,” both “Judah and Israel” are to be restored, but if so, where are the ten tribes?
