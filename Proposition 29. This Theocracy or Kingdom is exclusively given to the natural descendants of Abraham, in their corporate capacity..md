# Proposition 29. This Theocracy or Kingdom is exclusively given to the natural descendants of Abraham, in their corporate capacity.

### Props Mentioned
None
### Given to the seed of Abraham
> . . . the Kingdom is solely given to *the seed of Abraham*, which embraced the Jews.  For God condescended only  to act *as earthly Ruler* in behalf of that *one* nation, the *election* being thus practically demonstrated in their nationality.
> p. 230 Vol. 1 Prop. 29 Obs. 1

>... the Kingdom belongs to the faithful Jews and to those who are received as such because of faith in the Messiah. Abraham’s seed, however produced, *natural or engrafted*, receive the Kingdom.
>p. 230 Vol. 1 Prop. 29 Obs. 1
### If needed, God would raise up a nation
>Obs. 2. So sure is this Kingdom to the seed of Abraham, by virtue of *covenant and oath*, that when the Lord was displeased with the nation at the establishment of the Theocracy and threatened its extermination, yet, to insure the fulfilment of His *pledged* word, He proposed that of Moses, He would raise up such a nation. The same is intimated by John the Baptist (Matt. 3:9) when, the Jews refusing to repent, he told them that God could, if it was requisite, raise up children to Abraham by supernatural power. Such instances teach that, rather *than fail*, God can work to any extent demanded, *but always in the Jewish line*—i.e. all who are ever to enjoy His special Theocratic favor must, in some way, be regarded as the descendants, the children of Abraham.
>p. 230 Vol. 1 Prop. 29 Obs. 2
### Intermarriages forbidden
>Obs. 3. This gives us one of the reasons why intermarriages with heathen were forbidden, why Ezra and Nehemiah manifested such zeal in purging the Jewish nation, why the amalgamation of the Jewish with other nations was prohibited.
>p. 231 Vol. 1 Prop. 29 Obs. 3
### Theocratic idea is nation's founding principle
> No reader of the Old Test. can fail to see that the Theocratic idea is *the nation's foundation principle*, permeating all that pertains to it.
> p. 231 Vol. 1 Prop. 29 Obs. 4
### Theocracy was their proud boast
>Obs. 5. This feature, the Theocracy alone pertaining to the Jews, was their proud boast, as seen e.g. Deut. 4:32-40, Ps. 147:20.
### Key to "King of the Jews"
> This is the Key to the significant superscription of the cross : "*This is the King of the Jews.*"
> p. 231 Vol. 1 Prop. 29 Obs. 6

>... it may be in place to urge the reader to consider why Jesus should be *specifically* designated on the cross *only* as “*the King of the Jews*” and not of Jews and Gentiles or of nations generally. There must be some valid reason *why* as the King of the Jews, He becomes the King over all nations.
