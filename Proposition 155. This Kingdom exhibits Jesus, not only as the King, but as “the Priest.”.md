# Proposition 155. This Kingdom exhibits Jesus, not only as the King, but as “the Priest.”

>In the restored Theocracy this priesthood is represented differently from that one once connected with it. The High-Priest and the king were separate personages, but to preserve unity in the coming Theocracy, the priesthood and kingship are united in the same Person. Hence, the Messiah is designated a Priest as well as a King in His official relationship as the Theocratic Head.
### High priest was God's earthly representative
>Obs. 1. The High-Priest was God’s representative on earth.
### Continue forever
>Obs. 2. The Scriptures, when speaking of the priesthood of the Messiah, makes it something that shall evermore continue.
### Includes royalty
>Obs. 3. This Priesthood is a royal one, i.e. it is firmly, inseparably united to His royalty.
### Jesus is a priest
>Obs. 4. Now, He is a Priest (Heb. 8:1) on the Father’s throne, and when He is on His own throne (as David’s Son, Rev. 3:21) He continues Priest, simply because His great sacrificial act, performed once for all, ever stamps Him as a Priest—a successful and acknowledged High-Priest.
### Jesus lives forever and is a priest forever
>Obs. 5. Therefore, the continuity of His priesthood is identified with the perpetuity of His own existence (Heb. 7:24, 25): “But this man (Jesus) because He continueth ever (Gr. remains forever) hath an unchangeable priesthood.” “He ever liveth to make intercession.” It cannot be taken from Him and given to others, but as long as He exists, so long does the priesthood pertain to Him. He alone stands forth in all succeeding ages as the High-Priest. In an epistle specially devoted to exhibit “the unchangeable priesthood” of Jesus, it is expressly declared (Heb. 13:8): “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever.
### Priest like Melchisedec
>Obs. 7. This priesthood, being after the similitude of Melchisedec, is exhibited in its completeness with His kingship.
### Saints to be kings and priests along with elder Brother
>Obs. 8. If the saints are to be “kings and priests” in the future Kingdom (Props. 118, 153, 154), then it follows that the Elder Brother is also the same.
### Priest of "the everlasting covenant"
>Obs. 9. Jesus, the Christ, ever remains “an High-Priest of good things to come” (Heb. 9:11), inasmuch as the Redemptive work, of which He is the Priestly-Head, shall continue after the Sec. Advent. This is seen in the finished Redemption of His brethren and in the blessings enjoyed by them; in the conversion of the Jewish nation, which obtains repentance and grace though His blood and intercession, after His Coming; in the mercy and happiness bestowed upon the spared Gentile nations after His Advent and conflict with Antichrist, which can only be predicated of His priestly influence; and in the perpetuation of the human race for saving purposes and the glory of God, which results from His continued efficiency as Mediator. He is the Priest of “the everlasting covenant” and as such He not only provides the provision for its realization, but being its “surety” He remains personally interested in the same, and secures it for us.
### Ultimate crushing of Satan and sin
>Obs. 10. The Theocracy is designed to secure for us all the forfeited blessings. To do this, and bring in the predicted righteousness and glory, demands the personal supervision of our High-Priest. Full and complete deliverance from sin and evil, so far as this earth and this race is concerned, is only promised to exist one thousand years (and a little season, Rev. 20) after the Sec. Advent. The priestly office will yet evidence its sufficiency in wresting from Satan His victory, and in ultimately crushing out all sin and all its sad consequences.
### Spirituality connected with the Kingdom
>Obs. 11. Such a continuing High-Priest evidences the spirituality connected with this Kingdom.
### Consider Jesus, our high priest
>Obs. 12. When we consider the greatness and majesty of this High-Priest, the incomparable and all-sufficient sacrifice offered, the exaltation and power, God’s special choice and not man’s, bearing the people on His loving breast, His immense superiority over all other priests, His confirmation by oath and perfection, His Holiness, then we can rest assured that His priestly work will be fully accomplished, and that as the priestly agent He will ever, as such, rejoice in it.
### Largely pertains to the humanity of the Christ
>Obs. 13. It is only requisite to remind the reader, that this priesthood largely pertains to the humanity of the Christ.
### Primitive Church view confirms
>Obs. 14. The Primitive-Church view confirms our position. For several centuries after the First Advent, the ministers clearly taught the Pre-Mill. Advent, the conversion of the nations following, etc., thus continuing the priestly work of Jesus in mediation, intercession, and saving purposes.
### Confirmed by eminent writers
>Obs. 15. The views of eminent writers and commentators, corroborating this doctrine, tends to show, that in the estimation of such, it is a truth clearly taught, which should be unhesitatingly received.
### Endless succession of generations
>Obs. 16. This unchangeable priesthood, in connection with the ever-enduring priesthood of the saints, seems to confirm the opinion of those who hold to an endless succession of generations (comp. Prop. 152, on Perp. of Race). We would not deny the inference, because it possesses weighty reasons for its entertainment, and such a succession for many ages, at least, is clearly taught. But we can easily conceive of a continued priesthood, even if such a perpetuation of the race should cease, on the ground that the superior, the ruling power, will always minister in Divine things to the inferior, the subjected one. We leave this matter, as stated in Prop. 152.
