# Proposition 189. It is only through this doctrine of the Kingdom that the Apocalypse can or will be understood and consistently interpreted.

>The reason for this lies in the simple fact that it announces the Coming and the events connected with the Advent of the Theocratic King. Now to enter fully into its spirit and appreciate its force, to form an adequate conception of the testimony of Jesus either as a whole or in its several aspects, there must of necessity be & previous acquaintance with the covenants and a correct apprehension of the burden of prophecy based on those covenants, resolving itself into the promised Kingdom.

>Obs. 1. The Theocratic idea, in the very nature of the case, must ever be kept in view, for with it the Apocalypse begins and ends. It begins with announcing His Future Advent, and delineates His Theocratical character as “the Prince of the kings of the earth.” and the Alpha and Omega” etc., and ends with the Theocratical rule inaugurated here on earth.

>a full, complete’ and satisfactory exposition of the Book is something that is still lacking. Not one—however valuable—but bears grave defects.
