>This is seen in one simple fact presented in all of them. Lange (Com. Rev., p. 114) has well observed: “The fundamental idea of all the seven epistles is the fundamental idea of the Apocalypse itself—the Coming of the Lord.” This is the key-note of the introductory to, and the solemn admonition and anticipation in, all of them.
>p. 377 Vol. 3 Prop. 190

>We cannot possibly receive the view entertained by some (Barnes, Stuart, etc.) that these Epistles are simply historic, and are only intended for us in so far as the principles laid down and the admonitions given are of general application. The fact that these representations extend to the Second Advent, while the seven historic churches have long since passed away, is in itself sufficient to set aside such an interpretation.
>p. 377 Vol. 3 Prop. 190 Obs. 1

>We cannot accept of the opinion (so Vitringa, etc.) that these seven churches are typical or representative of seven successive periods of Church history.
>p. 377 Vol. 3 Prop. 190 Obs. 2


>We prefer the simple idea that the seven churches, as they contemporaneously existed, are typical, representative, prophetical of seven prominent plumes or conditions of the Church, contemporaneously present, but becoming more and more intensive as we near the Second Advent.
>p. 379 Vol. 3 Prop. 190 Obs. 3

>“the seven churches represent the Church catholic in its totality the universality of appeal in reference to hearing, ch. 2:7, 11, 17, 29 and ch. 3:6, 13, 22; the appropriateness of the addresses to the Church universal in cautions, warnings, promises, commendations, rebukes, and encouragements; the past and present fulfilment of the conditions specified in the history of the Church (for without attempting a regular succession, it must be admitted that such phases or conditions have always, more or less, existed down to the present); that seven and only seven churches, and these by far from being the most prominent, are selected; that these churches are represented as enduring to the end,
>p. 379 Vol. 3 Prop. 190 Obs. 3

>Let its take this representative character of the seven churches, almost universally conceded by able writers, and it is in full accord with our doctrinal position. Thus, to notice only a few points indicative of this agreement, let the reader consider the following: 
>1. The condition of the Church itself—mixed, containing tares and wheat, tempted and tried, false profession and true love, defection and faithful adhesion—is evidence that we have properly delineated the same, and the design of the present dispensation. 
>2. This condition of the Church existing down to the Sec. Advent, unmistakably shows that no Millennial age can possibly intervene. The prophetic portrayal positively forbids it. It accords only with our doctrinal faith, seeing that such a conversion of the world, as multitudes advocate, is entirely removed from the description. 
>3. The Sec. Advent of Jesus assumes the prominence that we give it, being urged as warning, encouragement, and hope. It is the special feature, relating to Redemption and fulfilment of covenant promise, which our faith is to grasp and our hearts to respond to in order that it may be to us an inestimable blessing and not a curse. 
>4. The special promises to incite to faithfulness are not made dependent upon death, but upon this Sec. Coming. In consistency with our position and teaching, the honor and glory to be brought to the redeemed is identified with the Coming of the Christ. 
>5. These epistles unite with this Sec. Advent, the restoration of Paradise and the tree of life, the Millennial exemption from afflictions, sorrow, tears, and death, the exaltation and glorious reign of the saints, the realization of co-heirship and co-judgeship with the Christ. These things alone are abundantly confirmatory of our expressed belief and interpretation of the Scriptures.
>p. 381 Vol. 3 Prop. 190 Obs. 4 slightly reformatted


>Indeed, these epistles if in agreement with the general analogy of the Word, must, of necessity, make the Church a probationary and preparatory stage, and must designate with special prominence the Second Advent, because then the glorious promises of God, covenanted and predicted, with be amply realized.
