>This is seen in one simple fact presented in all of them. Lange (Com. Rev., p. 114) has well observed: “The fundamental idea of all the seven epistles is the fundamental idea of the Apocalypse itself—the Coming of the Lord.” This is the key-note of the introductory to, and the solemn admonition and anticipation in, all of them.
>p. 377 Vol. 3 Prop. 190

>We cannot possibly receive the view entertained by some (Barnes, Stuart, etc.) that these Epistles are simply historic, and are only intended for us in so far as the principles laid down and the admonitions given are of general application. The fact that these representations extend to the Second Advent, while the seven historic churches have long since passed away, is in itself sufficient to set aside such an interpretation.
>p. 377 Vol. 3 Prop. 190 Obs. 1

>We cannot accept of the opinion (so Vitringa, etc.) that these seven churches are typical or representative of seven successive periods of Church history.
>p. 377 Vol. 3 Prop. 190 Obs. 2


>We prefer the simple idea that the seven churches, as they contemporaneously existed, are typical, representative, prophetical of seven prominent plumes or conditions of the Church, contemporaneously present, but becoming more and more intensive as we near the Second Advent.
>p. 379 Vol. 3 Prop. 190 Obs. 3

>“the seven churches represent the Church catholic in its totality the universality of appeal in reference to hearing, ch. 2:7, 11, 17, 29 and ch. 3:6, 13, 22; the appropriateness of the addresses to the Church universal in cautions, warnings, promises, commendations, rebukes, and encouragements; the past and present fulfilment of the conditions specified in the history of the Church (for without attempting a regular succession, it must be admitted that such phases or conditions have always, more or less, existed down to the present); that seven and only seven churches, and these by far from being the most prominent, are selected; that these churches are represented as enduring to the end,
>p. 379 Vol. 3 Prop. 190 Obs. 3


>Indeed, these epistles if in agreement with the general analogy of the Word, must, of necessity, make the Church a probationary and preparatory stage, and must designate with special prominence the Second Advent, because then the glorious promises of God, covenanted and predicted, with be amply realized.
