>This is not only reasonable, but shown to be a fact, from the apostles having no occasion during their entire ministry to censure any orthodox believers or churches for misapprehending, or holding to a false view of, the Kingdom. The decided and convincing impression is made by the apostolic writings that these first Christian churches were not ignorant of—but correctly understood—the important and cardinal subject of the Kingdom.

>Obs. 1. Let the student candidly consult the faith.of the early churches and see for himself what it was, viz.: that the intimations of Scripture, the statements of the Fathers, the concessions of Neander, Mosheim, and a host of others, and, in brief, all that we have on record of that period, conclusively proves that the doctrine held, both in Jewish and Gentile regions, was at first (during the First, Second, and greater part of the Third, Century,) that which we have defended.


>This feature, so noticeable in the Jews under the prophets, under Jesus, and under the Apostles, and thus continuously perpetuated, led Auberlen (Proph. Dan., p. 372) to pertinently remark, that Jesus, and the Prophets and Apostles, were “Chiliasts.” The early Church in its entire range was Chiliastic, and eagerly looked, longed, and prayed for the expected Kingdom still future. Enemies and friends, historians and. theologians, frankly acknowledge this distinguishing characteristic of that period.
>Obs, 1

>We, on the contrary, hold that, according to the truth, it was impossible for the first churches under the personal teaching and supervision of inspired men to have any other faith respecting the Kingdom than that which history ascribes to the first Christians.
>Obs. 4

>Obs. 5. Our doctrine has a Jewish origin, founded upon Jewish covenants, Jewish predictions, Jewish faith, and a Jewish Messiah (Prop. 68, 69, etc.).

>Chiliasm is not doctrinally fixed by the duration of the reign (Prop. 159), but is determined by the nature of the Messianic Kingdom.
>Obs. 5

>Faith and obedience inspired hope that the covenanted promises, pertaining to the Kingdom, would be verified through Christ at His coming again; any other position, in view of what preceded and surrounded them, would have been unnatural and opposed to the truth.
>Obs. 6

>This early faith in the Kingdom, is evidence of consistent divine teaching, of apostolic supervision, of God’s determination to fulfil His oath-bound covenant of the true Scriptural conception of the Messiah as covenanted of the validity of adopting grace, and of our ultimately inheriting at the Sec. Advent, “the sure mercies of David.”
>Obs. 8

>They forget that Millenarians were the very first who opposed, on the one hand, the Jewish spirit of self-righteousness, and, on the other hand, the Jewish libertinism, as antagonistic to the religion of Jesus Christ.


>Obs. 12. The student, who is really desirous to see how extensively our doctrine was held, will consider these points of evidence adduced. 
>1. (1) How universally the Jews held to our doctrine, e.g. Prop. 20; 
>2. (2) How this was confirmed by the Prophecies, e.g. Props. 21, 33, 35, 51; 
>3. (3) how this belief grew out of the covenants, e.g. Props. 46, 47, 48, 49, 52; 
>4. (4) -that the preaching of John re-established the faith in many, e.g.Props. 38, 39, 40; 
>5. (5) that the preaching of the disciples was calculated to increase the belief, as e.g. Props. 43, 54, 55, etc.; 
>6. (6) that no controversy was raised on the subject, e.g. Prop. 44; 
>7. (7) that the preaching of Jesus confirmed the faith in His disciples and hearers, as e.g. Props. 42, 43, 44, 54, 55, 57, 58, etc.; 
>8. (8) how the continued faith in the same was preserved and perpetuated by the postponement taught, e.g. Props. 57 to 68; 
>9. (9) that the death of Jesus did not remove the belief, Prop. 70; 
>10. (10) how the preaching and language of the apostles was calculated to enforce the belief, e.g. Props. 71, 72, 73. (Thus far there is a connected chain, which indicates how generally our doctrine must have been entertained; but the proof is far from being exhausted. Candor requires the consideration of what follows. 
>11. (11) That the doctrine was received through the apostles shown more clearly under Props. 73, in no controversy springing up concerning it; under Prop. 74 in the belief of a speedy Advent; under Prop, 75 in its perpetuation, and Prop. 76, gradual change.
>Obs. 12 reformatted

>How could John, under Divine guidance, well knowing the Jewish views that were current (which our opponents fully admit as we have shown), pen down the portraiture of a Messianic reign (Rev. 20:1-6 and 11:15-18), which in its plain grammatical sense corresponds so accurately with the prevailing Jewish opinions, unless such a sense contains the truth?
>Obs. 14
