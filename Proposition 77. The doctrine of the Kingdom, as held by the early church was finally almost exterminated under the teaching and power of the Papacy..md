# Proposition 77. The doctrine of the Kingdom, as held by the early church was finally almost exterminated under the teaching and power of the Papacy.

>This is so plain a historical fact that it needs no special evidence to sustain it. Roman Catholic writers, ecclesiastical historians, and others, have repeatedly recorded the statement, and no denial of it has ever appeared.
>p. 513 Vol. 1 Prop. 76
### Papacy
>Obs. 1. The Papacy has been ever hostile to our doctrine, owing to the Chiliastic opposition to its pretensions, its provisions looking to futurity, its hierarchical endowments, corruptions, and bold assumptions of being the promised Kingdom.
>p. 513 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 1
### Origen
>Obs. 2. In the very nature of the case, *the Chiliastic Kingdom* of the Abrahamic-Davidic covenant as taught by the Fathers, *the hope* in the constantly expected Advent of Jesus to establish such a Kingdom, *the anticipated struggle* with an Antichrist in ecclesiastical-political power, the view entertained respecting the church as a struggling, tried body awaiting deliverance and triumph *alone* through the personal Advent of the Messiah —*these prevented* aspiring prelates and the ambitious learned from endorsing it. It was an easy matter, by adopting the Origenistic interpretation of several senses, to reject *the covenanted* restored Davidic throne and Kingdom under a personal Messiah, and to substitute in its place *an existing* Kingdom under the rule of appointed hierarchs, and *claim* that in and through them Christ was already reigning in His promised Kingdom.
>p. 514 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 2
### Church authority
>Obs. 3. When a church arrogates to itself the great honor of showing forth *within its borders* the predicted millennial glory (as e.g. Eusebius and others, dating its inauguration from Constantine, or Augustine and others, dating the same from the First Advent of Christ); when it enforces the belief by *a wholesale appropriation* of prophecy without the least regard to its connection, covenant basis, prospective attitude, relation to the Jewish nation, union with the Sec. Advent, etc.; when it hedges this around by a confessional barrier, and calls for all its membership to receive it as the truth—*then*, especially when it has the ecclesiastical and civil power under its control *to compel obedience*, it is not strange that the doctrine, *so hostile* to these arrogant assumptions as ours, should be hated and depressed.
>p. 515 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 3
### Scholars claiming chiliasm was the Roman Catholic faith of more than one century
>... the Roman Church “*has grossly falsified the creed of antiquity*, inasmuch as there is *ample evidence* that the doctrine of the Chiliasts *was actually the Catholic faith* of more than one century.”
>-- Chillingworth (*Works*, Dis. 5)
>p. 516 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 4
### Papacy spirit and aim
>Obs. 5. It may then be briefly stated as a self-evident fact, that the entire spirit and aim of the Papacy is *antagonistic* to the early church view, being based on coveted ecclesiastical and secular power, on extended jurisdiction lodged in the hands of a Primate.
>p. 516-517 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 5
### Monkery
>Obs. 6. The institution of monkery exerted a powerful influence in causing the rapid decline of our doctrine.
>p. 517 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 6
### Councils
>Obs. 7. The authority of Councils in the interest of hierarchical tendencies materially aided in obscuring the doctrine of the Kingdom.
>p. 518 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 7

>The decisions of Councils were finally elevated *to an equality* with the Scriptures, and thus aided in crushing the doctrine.
>p. 518 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 7
### Control of Theological teachings
>Obs. 8. Theology, under the constant surveillance of a church *jealous* of its delegated kingly authority, in its more systematic arrangements, was entirely controlled so as *to favor the substituted* Kingdom. We find, therefore, in all such works, running down through the scholastic age to the Reformation, a set apologetic defence of the Romish notions of the Kingdom.
>p. 519 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 8
### Not entirely extirpated
>Obs. 10, Baronius and others have asserted that for a long time the doctrine was “entirely extirpated.” This is *not strictly* correct. It certainly was brought into such disfavor by a ruling Romish Church that during “the dark ages,” down to the Reformation, *it was scarcely known*.
>p. 521 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 10
### Not the advent of Jesus to judgement ~ 1000
>Obs. 11. Various writers in tracing our doctrine have, through inadvertency or misapprehension of our belief, made *the unscholarly mistake* of attributing a revival of our faith to the extended belief in the Advent of Jesus to judgment about the year A.D. 1000 and succeeding dates, and, with evident relish, endeavor to make our system accountable for the calamitous results (so graphically described by Mosheim). But this belief arose from *the Romish view, and not from Millenarianism*.
>p. 522 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 11

>Now this was *the opposite* of Millenarian views, which made the Millennium future, to be introduced by a resurrection, and to be followed by a glorious restoration of all things. The misapplication of the Millenary (making it Pre-Advent) and of the Sec. Advent (making it Post-Millennial) is *purely Romish error*, and, in view of the extent in which it was held and the miseries that it entailed, is decisive proof how largely Millenarianism had been obliterated.
>p. 522 Vol. 1 Prop. 76 Obs. 11
