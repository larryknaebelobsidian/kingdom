# Purpose of Selected Quotations

To call attention to this forgotten 141 year old book (1884) whose topic is God's magnficent **Kingdom yet to come**, a very major theme of the Bible.

To encourage you to buy the three volume book set (as I have done) and read the full work yourself. I have no financial gain in this. "Selected Quotations" is merely some of my personally selected quotations from Peters' 3-volume, 2100 page book.

To provide a free and convenient electronic subset of Peters' work that supports:
- searching the selected quotations (using your epub reader)
- providing an electronic list of all 206 propositions in the "**List of Propositions**"
- providing a **Props Mentioned** section in each proposition to ease further research of related propositions
- providing **pericopes** for most observations to enhance thought organization and recall. NOTE: These pericopes are mainly phrases taken directly from Peters' text.
- viewing each proposition's title and pericopes only (using your epub reader's **Table of Contents** view)
- "Selected Quotations" has also been generated in PDF.

To glorify God -- Father, Son and Holy Spirit

Come, Lord Jesus
