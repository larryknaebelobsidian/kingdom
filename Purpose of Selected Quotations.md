# Purpose of Selected Quotations

I heard about "The Theocratic Kingdom" book by George N. H. Peters (originally published 1884) earlier in my life but never looked into it. The original title is "*The Theocratic Kingdom of Our Lord Jesus, the Christ, as Covenanted in the Old Testament and Presented in the New Testament*".  I had heard it was perhaps the most significant work attempting to show that the early church believed in a literal 1000 year kingdom that would be set up here on this earth after Jesus returned from heaven.  This is the doctrine known as Premillenialism or Chiliasm.  This is in opposition to the views called Amillenialism and Postmillenialism. Little did I realize that Peters' work was much more than that.

After retirement, I took the time to buy Peters' 2100 page 3-volume book and began to read and enjoy it.  As I read it I marked it up (as I usually do when I read a book) and then considered that it might be more beneficial to take my own notes electronically.  I chose to use a free markdown tool called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).  Obsidian also has the ability (via plugins) to export notes in other formats (like epub and pdf). I wanted to be able to review these quotations on my smart phone using any freely available epub reader. 

I encourage you to buy Peters' three volume book set and read the full work yourself. 

Although "Selected Quotations" contains very few of my personal notes, I have added pericopes for many observations within each proposition, a separate "Props Mentioned" section for each proposition, but it mainly contains my selected quotations from all of Peters' 206 propositions found in his book. The direct quotations are shown as indented blocks of text. I have slightly reformatted some of them but have noted those. All quotations are referenced so you can find them in the printed book for further study.
