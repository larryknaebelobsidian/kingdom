# Purpose of Selected Quotations

To call attention to this forgotten 140 year old book (1884) whose topic is God's magnficent Kingdom to come.

To encourage you to buy the three volume book set (as I have done) and read the full work yourself. I have no financial gain in this. "Selected Quotations" is merely some of my personally selected quotations from Peters' book.

To provide a free and handy electronic subset of Peters' work that supports:
- searching the selected quotations (using your epub reader)
- providing an electronic list of all 206 propositions in the "**List of Propositions**"
- providing a **Props Mentioned** section in each proposition to ease further research of related propositions
- providing **pericopes** for most observations to enhance thought organization and recall. NOTE: These pericopes are mainly phrases taken directly from Peters' text.
- viewing each proposition's pericopes only (using your epub reader's **Table of Contents** view)
- "Selected Quotations" has also been generated in PDF.

To glorify God -- Father, Son and Holy Spirit

Come, Lord Jesus
Rev. 22:20

<small>Navigation hint: To quickly move to a proposition you may find it helpful to use your epub reader's search feature.  Example: to find proposition 170, search for "N 170." (without the quotes). Also, the Table of Contents feature of your epub reader provides an outline of each proposition from the pericopes.</small>
