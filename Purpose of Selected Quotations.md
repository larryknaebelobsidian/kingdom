# Purpose of Selected Quotations

I heard about "The Theocratic Kingdom" book by George N. H. Peters (originally published 1884) earlier in my life but never looked into it. The original title is "*The Theocratic Kingdom of Our Lord Jesus, the Christ, as Covenanted in the Old Testament and Presented in the New Testament*".  I had heard it was perhaps the most significant work attempting to show that the early church believed in a literal 1000 year kingdom that would be set up here on this earth after Jesus returned from heaven.  This is the doctrine known as Premillenialism or Chiliasm.  This is in opposition to the views called Amillenialism and Postmillenialism. Little did I realize that Peters' work was much more than that.

After retirement, I took the time to buy Peters' 2100 page 3-volume book and began to read and enjoy it.  As I read it I marked it up (as I usually do when I read a book) and then considered that it might be more beneficial to take my own notes electronically.  I chose to use a free markdown tool called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).  Obsidian also has the ability (via plugins) to export notes in other formats (like epub and pdf). I wanted to be able to review my notes on my smart phone using the freely available epub readers. 

I encourage you to buy Peters' three volume book set and read the full work yourself. 

"Selected Quotations" contains my notes (actually very few personal notes but with my pericopes) and my selected quotations from Peters' book. I use these notes to review all of Peters' 206 Propositions. If I want to dig deeper I get out the printed book. Each note's title is the Proposition name and each note consists mostly of direct quotations from Peters' work. Direct quotations are shown as indented blocks of text. I have attempted to include precise references to all quotations so you can find them in the printed book for further research.
