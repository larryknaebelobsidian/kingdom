# Purpose of Selected Quotations

To encourage you to buy the three volume book set (as I have done) and read the full work yourself. I have no financial gain in this.

To provide a free and handy electronic subset of Peters work that supports:
- searching the selected quotations (using your epub reader)
- providing an electronic list of all 206 propositions in the "**List of Propositions**"
- providing a **Props Mentioned** section in each proposition to ease further research of related propositions
- providing **pericopes** for most observations to enhance thought organization and recall. NOTE: These pericopes are mainly phrases taken directly from the text of Peters' words.
- viewing each proposition's pericopes only (using your epub reader's **Table of Contents** view)
- "Selected Quotations" has also been generated in PDF.

To glorify God -- Father, Son and Holy Spirit
