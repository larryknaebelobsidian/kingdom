>The student who has followed our argument will at once anticipate such a result, for the Kingdom, in its *Theocratic aspect*, with its design and connections (e.g. restored Jewish nation), *cannot possibly* be erected here on earth without *a fearful commotion, the most terrible convulsions* among the nations, in which nature itself is represented as partaking. The Millennial descriptions are introduced by this preparatory shaking, and every prophet, more or less, has portrayed its *dreadful* nature. It is sufficient to direct attention to two passages, which clearly announce it. Hag. 2:6, 7, “*Thus saith the Lord of Hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earthy and the sea, and the dry land: and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory*,” etc. Heb. 12:26, 27, 28, “*Whose (God’s) voice then (at Mt. Sinai) shook the earth: but now He hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. “Wherefore we receiving a Kingdom, which cannot he moved, let us*” etc. Two facts locate the fulfilment of these passages in the future, viz., (1) that before and at the First Advent there was *no such shaking*, for universal peace (Kurtz’s *Sac. His*., p. 273) existed when Jesus came, and (2) that Paul in Hebrew speaks of this shaking, not as past, but as future.
