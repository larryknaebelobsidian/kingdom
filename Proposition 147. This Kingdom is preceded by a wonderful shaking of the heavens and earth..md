>The student who has followed our argument will at once anticipate such a result, for the Kingdom, in its *Theocratic aspect*, with its design and connections (e.g. restored Jewish nation), *cannot possibly* be erected here on earth without *a fearful commotion, the most terrible convulsions* among the nations, in which nature itself is represented as partaking. The Millennial descriptions are introduced by this preparatory shaking, and every prophet, more or less, has portrayed its *dreadful* nature. It is sufficient to direct attention to two passages, which clearly announce it. Hag. 2:6, 7, “*Thus saith the Lord of Hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earthy and the sea, and the dry land: and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory*,” etc. Heb. 12:26, 27, 28, “*Whose (God’s) voice then (at Mt. Sinai) shook the earth: but now He hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. “Wherefore we receiving a Kingdom, which cannot he moved, let us*” etc. Two facts locate the fulfilment of these passages in the future, viz., (1) that before and at the First Advent there was *no such shaking*, for universal peace (Kurtz’s *Sac. His*., p. 273) existed when Jesus came, and (2) that Paul in Hebrew speaks of this shaking, not as past, but as future.

### Incorrect interpretations
>Obs. 1. Unfortunately with the rejection of the doctrine of the Kingdom, many writers not knowing what else to do with the passages quoted, apply them to the First Advent, thus forsaking the Early Church view which understood them to refer to the future Advent.

>The re-established Theocracy under David’s Son introduces the Desire of all nations, bestows peace and prosperity, brings a glory to the Davidic and Lord’s house transcendently greater than the world has ever yet witnessed. But this can never be realized without the most extraordinary revolutions, the most unprecedented changes and convulsions, which are characterized as “a shaking of the heavens and earth” Jesus (Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:25; Luke 21:26), in accord with the general tenor of prophecy, predicts that “the powers of the heavens shall be shaken” which is linked with “distress of nations” “mourning of the tribes of the earthy” “men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth” and “the Coming of the Son of man in the clouds of heaven.”

>This shaking, too, as the connection shows, is for purposes of overthrow, utter destruction, and radical change; it is preliminary to the setting up of a Kingdom that cannot be moved, i.e. everlasting, ever-enduring.
