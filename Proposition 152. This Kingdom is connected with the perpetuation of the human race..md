# Proposition 152. This Kingdom is connected with the perpetuation of the human race.
## Props Mentioned
[154](Proposition%20154.%20This%20Theocratic%20Kingdom%20includes%20the%20visible%20reign%20of%20the%20risen%20and%20glorified%20saints%20here%20on%20the%20earth..md) [156](Proposition%20156.%20The%20doctrine%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20enforces%20the%20future%20priesthood%20of%20the%20saints..md) 
### Perpetual, eternal continuation not denied
>Able writers (as D. N. Lord, Rev. Newton, etc.), contend for an eternal, everlasting perpetuation of the race, perpetual and strictly never-ending, and rely exclusively upon the words rendered “eternal,” “perpetual,” “forever,” etc. The argument thus presented looks plausible and weighty; sufficiently so, that while not fully accepting of it, we at the same time do not deny it.
>p. 538 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 2
### Many generations Isa. 60:15
>Our position is this: We are satisfied to end the discussion where *the Bible ends it*, viz., with a portion of the race glorified and the race itself redeemed from the curse, passing on to higher stages of blessedness, and entering *into the eternal ages* in this happy condition. If Adam forfeited never-ending generations—if this was part of God’s original design—*then* the restitution will restore and carry it out; but if not, *then only* that wonderful increase commensurate with God’s design will be produced. Here we stop: that the race is perpetuated *after* the Advent is true; that this will continue on *after* the thousand years (which only limits Satan’s binding, etc.), is most certain; that it even may continue on forever may, for aught we know, be also correct (seeing that some language can scarcely be interpreted otherwise), but as to the latter, not feeling positive, we stop with “*the many generations*” of Isa. 60:15.

>... such a posture accords best with the ideas of the primitive church on the subject.

### Millennial unsaved will produce children
>"But Irenaeus and Lactantius, who were Millenarians, *do not* express themselves in  that manner; what they say is, that at the time of the first resurrection there will be found some good men living upon the earth, and that of them, in the space of a thousand years, shall be born a numerous race, a godly seed, *over whom* likewise the raised saints are to reign, and by whom they are to be served."
>-- Dr. Lardner (Lardner's *Works*, vol. 2, p. 691, etc., Bickersteth's *Guide*, p. 190, etc.)
>p. 539 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 3
### There will be unsaved humans in the Millennium
>Briefly, it would be interesting to trace in what manner this early doctrine, once so prevalent—that the Jewish nation and Gentiles in the flesh *would survive* the Advent, and the fearful judgments then poured out upon the nations, and would form the subjects of that world-wide dominion under Christ and His resurrected brethren—was gradually undermined and finally almost rooted out.
>p. 541 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 4

>... no one has ever yet found *a passage within the Bible that directly teaches* that the multiplication of the race ceases after the Advent of Christ; ...
>p. 542 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 4
### Salvation continues in the Millennium
>Thus Dr. Brown informs us that “the Church will be absolutely complete at Christ’s Coming,” and implies from this that after that *no others* will be saved. Aside from our direct arguments in various Propositions which prove that such a conclusion is erroneous, it is sufficient to say that our doctrine itself embraces *the completeness of the elect* (i.e. those gathered out and accounted worthy to become kings and priests), who become “*the first-fruits*,” “*the Church of the first-born*” associated with Christ in rulership, etc. The Scriptures teaching *such completeness*, which is consistent with the Plan of the administrations of the Kingdom, do not at the same time declare that no others—*after this specific number* of chosen ones are gathered—shall be saved. To say this is *adding* to the Word of God, and is not *to distinguish between things* that belong to different dispensations.
>p. 542 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 4

>... we have the Jewish nation converted by the appearance of the Messiah, and the spared of the Gentiles also receive and cordially embrace *the truth as it is in Jesus*. The universality of language does not by any means forbid the future conversion of nations under the administrations of King Jesus; for the wicked shall perish at the Coming of Jesus (as a class, those who are given up as incorrigible—even among the Jews), and yet some, who are willing to become *repentant and obedient*, shall be saved.
>p. 543 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 4

>... *the race’s grand destiny*; which bind the predictions from the earliest to the latest prophet into *one connected chain of evidence* testifying that the Kingdom of David’s Son is established here on the earth for the express purpose of unfolding and carrying on the eternal purposes of God respecting the race, for a time (“a moment”) delayed by the fall of man and the procedure required for redemption.
>p. 543-544 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 4
### Priesthood of Jesus and the Spirit 
>The “unchangeable priesthood” of Jesus Christ (Prop. 155), as well as the priestly office of His associated rulers (Prop. 156), certainly implies that there *must be generations of men* who are to be benefited by that priesthood extending into “*the ages*," seeing that it is founded on the adaptation and relation that it sustains to those (not glorified saints who themselves become “priests”) whom it is designed to benefit. The intercession is not limited and made intermediate between the two Advents. Thus also, the work of the Spirit for saving purposes is not confined to this dispensation (Prop. 171), etc., but extends into the age to come, where its greatest manifestations—in glorifying the saints, in converting, etc., the nations—are yet to be witnessed.
>p. 545 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 5

>It is -- in view of this *preponderating* evidence given through *different phases* of the subject and preserving *a unity* of purpose —simply faithless to suppose that the conflagration of Peter (Prop. 149 and 150) is to prevent the fulfilment of this perpetuation of the race.
