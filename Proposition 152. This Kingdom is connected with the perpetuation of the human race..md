## Props Mentioned
[[Proposition 154. This Theocratic Kingdom includes the visible reign of the risen and glorified saints here on the earth.|154]] [[Proposition 156. The doctrine of the Kingdom enforces the future priesthood of the saints.|156]] 

>Able writers (as D. N. Lord, Rev. Newton, etc.), contend for an eternal, everlasting perpetuation of the race, perpetual and strictly never-ending, and rely exclusively upon the words rendered “eternal,” “perpetual,” “forever,” etc. The argument thus presented looks plausible and weighty; sufficiently so, that while not fully accepting of it, we at the same time do not deny it.
>p. 538 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 2

### Many generations Isa. 60:15

>Our position is this: We are satisfied to end the discussion where the Bible ends it, viz., with a portion of the race glorified and the race itself redeemed from the curse, passing on to higher stages of blessedness, and entering into the eternal ages in this happy condition. If Adam forfeited never-ending generations—if this was part of God’s original design—then the restitution will restore and carry it out; but if not, then only that wonderful increase commensurate with God’s design will be produced. Here we stop: that the race is perpetuated after the Advent is true; that this will continue on after the thousand years (which only limits Satan’s binding, etc.), is most certain; that it even may continue on forever may, for aught we know, be also correct (seeing that some language can scarcely be interpreted otherwise), but as to the latter, not feeling positive, we stop with “the many generations” of Isa. 60:15.
>p. 538 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 2

>such a posture accords best with the ideas of the primitive church on the subject.
>p. 538 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 2

### Millennial unsaved will produce children

>Irenaeus and Lactantius, . . . at the time of the first resurrection there will be found some good men living upon the earth, and that of them, in the space of a thousand years, shall be born a numerous race, a godly seed, over whom likewise the raised saints are to reign, and by whom they are to be served.
>p. 539 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 3

### There will be millennial unsaved

>Briefly, it would be interesting to trace in what manner this early doctrine, once so prevalent—that the Jewish nation and Gentiles in the flesh *would survive* the Advent, and the fearful judgments then poured out upon the nations, and would form the subjects of that world-wide dominion under Christ and His resurrected brethren—was gradually undermined and finally almost rooted out.
>p. 539 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 4

>no one has ever yet found *a passage within the Bible that directly teaches* that the multiplication of the race ceases after the Advent of Christ;
>p. 542 Vol. 2 Prop. 152 Obs. 4

>Thus Dr. Brown informs us that “the Church will be absolutely complete at Christ’s Coming,” and implies from this that after that *no others* will be saved. Aside from our direct arguments in various Propositions which prove that such a conclusion is erroneous, it is sufficient to say that our doctrine itself embraces *the completeness of the elect* (i.e. those gathered out and accounted worthy to become kings and priests), who become “*the first-fruits*,” “*the Church of the first-born*” associated with Christ in rulership, etc. The Scriptures teaching *such completeness*, which is consistent with the Plan of the administrations of the Kingdom, do not at the same time declare that no others—*after this specific number* of chosen ones are gathered—shall be saved. To say this is *adding* to the Word of God, and is not *to distinguish between things* that belong to different dispensations.
