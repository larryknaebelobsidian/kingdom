>Able writers (as D. N. Lord, Rev. Newton, etc.), contend for an eternal, everlasting perpetuation of the race, perpetual and strictly never-ending, and rely exclusively upon the words rendered “eternal,” “perpetual,” “forever,” etc. The argument thus presented looks plausible and weighty; sufficiently so, that while not fully accepting of it, we at the same time do not deny it.

>Our position is this: We are satisfied to end the discussion where the Bible ends it, viz., with a portion of the race glorified and the race itself redeemed from the curse, passing on to higher stages of blessedness, and entering into the eternal ages in this happy condition. If Adam forfeited never-ending generations—if this was part of God’s original design—then the restitution will restore and carry it out; but if not, then only that wonderful increase commensurate with God’s design will be produced. Here we stop: that the race is perpetuated after the Advent is true; that this will continue on after the thousand years (which only limits Satan’s binding, etc.), is most certain; that it even may continue on forever may, for aught we know, be also correct (seeing that some language can scarcely be interpreted otherwise), but as to the latter, not feeling positive, we stop with “the many generations” of Isa. 60:15.

>such a posture accords best with the ideas of the primitive church on the subject.
