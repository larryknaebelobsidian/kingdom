### The force of the temptation
>the force of the temptation: 
>1. the first temptation is based on the actual existence of hunger and of real power lodged in the Christ; 
>2. the second on the protection promised to servants of God and God’s ability to protect; and so 
>3. the third is also based on facts, viz.: the promised Kingship of the Messiah on David’s throne and Kingdom, and the consequent attainment of Supreme Rulership over the world.
>Obs. 1 - reformatted
### Anti-chiliastic comments of some
>The far-fetched and one-sided comments of some who find in the third temptation “a negation of all the Chiliastic schemes of the synagogue”
>Obs. 2
### The kingdom is given by the Father
>Obs. 3. So unguardedly do able men express themselves on this subject that we find Neander (Life of Christ, on. 2 s. 27) declaring, “He regarded the establishment of a worldly Kingdom as inseparable from the worship of the devil and argues from this that Christ’s yielding to the establishment of such a Kingdom would have been “sinful.” It is admitted that the manner suggested by the devil would have been sinful, and to this Christ properly objected, but Neander travels beyond the record and confounds things that are different when he asserts that the possession of “all the Kingdoms of this world” would have been in itself sinful.
>...
>Therefore we firmly and consistently abide by the record which teaches that Christ rejected the worship of Satan by which the tender was bound, and not that He refused because He would not have “a world-dominion” here on the earth. Besides this, as we have seen, Prop. 83-9, the Kingdom is given to the Son by the Father, and the acceptance of the offer of Satan would have been a direct insult to the Father.
### Satan's mistake
>Obs. 4. The temptation would have failed in cogency and adherence, if such power had not, in some way, been the object or design of Christ a mission.
>...
>Satan’s mistake was in not fully apprehending that this Kingdom, owing to the unrepentant state of Jews and for gracious purposes of mercy, was to be postponed for a definite period, and that when the time arrived it was to be given to David’s Son by God Himself, and could not, in the nature of the case, be obtained by an act of worship to himself.
### Satan's real world possession
>Obs. 6. The reality of the world’s possession by Satan is claimed by him: “All this power will I give Thee, and the glory of them; for that is delivered unto me: and to whomsoever I will, I give it” (Luke 4:6). This reality is abundantly sustained by the titles given to him, “the Prince of this world,” “the god of this age.” He endeavors to assume the lordship and dominion forfeited by Adam, and how he succeeds is vividly portrayed in the Apocalypse, etc., especially exhibited just before the open revelation of Jesus, in the person and confederation of the Antichrist. Therefore it is that Revelation represents Satan as bound, so that the Sovereignty of this world is securely in the hands of the once tempted Jesus.
### Threat culminates in the end
>Obs. 7. Ebrard on the temptation of Jesus (Gospel His., p. 207) remarks: “But when Satan offers the whole world to Jesus, he reminds Him of the power which he exercises over this world of sinners.
>...
>But this threat, tacitly implied, culminates in the final great struggle, when all the forces of Satan are marshalled against Jesus and His army, to prevent Him, if possible, from securing this world-wide dominion (comp. Props. 161, 162, 163).
