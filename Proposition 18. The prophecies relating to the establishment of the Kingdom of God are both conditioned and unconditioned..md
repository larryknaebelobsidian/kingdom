# Proposition 18. The prophecies relating to the establishment of the Kingdom of God are both conditioned and unconditioned.

>By this paradox is simply meant that they are conditioned in their fulfilment by the antecedent gathering of the elect, and hence susceptible of postponement (as will be shown, e.g., Props. 58-68); and that they are unconditioned so far as their *ultimate* fulfilment is concerned, which the conduct or action of man cannot turn aside (as is seen, e.g., at the very time of the kingdomâ€™s manifestation, the nations, Rev. 19, will be arrayed against it).
>p. 176 Vol. 1 Prop. 18
### Moral freedom
>Obs. 2. The passages (Numb. 23:19, 1 Sam. 15:29, etc.) which speak of predictions as unconditional, and those (Jer. 18:7-10, etc.) which intimate their conditionality, are easily reconcilable from the simple fact, that the purposes of God run in connection with moral freedom, and that whilst the former is not set aside by the action of the latter, yet in the cases of individuals and even nations sufficient latitude is given so that there shall be no violation of that freedom.

### Some objections answered
>Obs. 3. In view of the important bearing that this point has upon several subjects connected with the Kingdom, it may prove desirable to answer, briefly, a few of the more generally used objections urged against our position.

### Kingdom itself not dependent on acceptance or rejection of man
