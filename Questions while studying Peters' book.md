[[Proposition 205. The doctrine of the Kingdom materially aids us in preaching “the Christ”— the distinctive “Messiah.”|Prop 205]]
[[Proposition 206. This earth will yet witness the re-establishment of a glorious Theocracy—a Theocracy in its perfected form.|Prop 206]]


## Nations
Who comprise the "nations" in the 1000 years?

Who comprise the "nations" in the eternal state?

## Translation / Resurrection

What is the relationship between resurrection and Peters' translation?

Are there more than two resurrections per Peters? If so, how many?

Is Peters' "translation" the same as the rapture?
	144,000 in Rev. 7 are sealed (Peter's believes translated)
	Earth is reaped (Rev. 14:16) Is this both a translation and resurrection?

Is there more than one rapture per Peters ("translation" of living saints - this is the word used by Peters)? If so, how many?

Who gets translated and when? (this seems to be related to rewards ([[Proposition 135. The doctrine of the Kingdom in full accord with the Scriptural doctrine of the judgment of believers,.|Prop. 135]]) for the faithful) 
## Conflagration
Prop. 149 - Peters says the conflagration comes BEFORE the millennium.  How does this agree with Revelation 21 (AFTER) Revelation 20? Peters' conflagration is a renewing of the heavens and earth, not a total vaporization of them.  Precisely how some humans/animals survive is not known.

## 144,000
Peters appears to believe that the sealing of the 144,000 (Rev 7) means that they are removed from the world.

Peters also appears to believe that the 144,000 seen with the Lamb on Mt. Zion, mentioned in Rev. 14, is a different group than the 144,000 mentioned in Rev. 7.
