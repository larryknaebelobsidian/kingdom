# Proposition 143. The early church doctrine of the Kingdom is supported by “the Rest” or keeping of the Sabbath, mentioned by Paul.

### Props Mentioned
130 151 159 160

>If it can be shown that the Sabbath was regarded as typical of the Kingdom of the Messiah as covenanted, and of the Millennial era, and then if it is found that Paul adopts the phraseology current on this point and uses it, *without change of meaning*, in a way to confirm the opinions existing, it forms an additional argument in favor of the primitive view of the Kingdom.
>p. 448 Vol.2 Prop. 143
### Jews viewed the kingdom as the seventh millenary of the world
>Obs. 1. Observe how the Jews believed on this subject. Bh. Newton has well stated (*Dis. on Proph.*, p. 587) on the thousand years of Rev. 20, “that the Jewish Church before John, and the Christian Church after him, have believed and taught that these one thousand years will be the *seventh Millenary* of the world.
>p. 448 Vol.2 Prop. 143 Obs. 1
### Jewish view was continued in Christian (Jewish and Gentile) Churches
>Obs. 2. Writers inform us that this Jewish opinion of the seventh Millenary, however we may account for it, was *continued* in the Christian, Jewish, and Gentile churches established by the apostles and their successors, and that it was entertained *both* by Millenarians and their opponents.
>p. 449 Vol.2 Prop. 143 Obs. 2

>... Augustine aided largely in overthrowing and darkening the early Church view of the Kingdom, ...
>p. 450 Vol. 2 Prop. 143 Obs. 2 
### Seventh chiliad may introduce something special
>Obs. 3. A few remarks may suggest reasons for there being so widespread and deeply imbedded a feeling that the seventh Millenary will introduce something extraordinary in the Divine Purpose.
>p. 452 Vol. 2 Prop. 143 Obs. 3
### Paul's view
>Obs. 4, Now, to return to the use made by Paul of this opinion entertained by the Jews. Brought up under Gamaliel, he *must have known how* the Jews regarded *the Sabbath as typical* of the reign of the Messiah, etc. Hence, the references made by him to this opinion, and their future application to Jesus Christ is *a virtual endorsement* of the same. We have, 
>
>*first*, his declaration, Col. 2:16, 17, that “*the Sabbaths are a shadow of things to come*” viz., typical of things future as related to Christ. 
>
>*Second*: the “*Rest*” which the Jews attributed to the Messianic reign, he applies, 2 Thess. 1:7, to the period of the future revelation of Jesus from heaven. The very phrase current to designate the Millennial glory (comp. Isa. 11:10), Paul refers to the Second Advent. 
>
>*Third*: The manner in which he employs the word “*Rest*” in Hebrews, being addressed to Jews, could not but confirm them in their belief of the future reign of the Messiah during the seventh Millenary. 
>(1) In chap. 3:11, 18 he calls *the promised land, the land of Canaan, the covenanted land*—the “*Rest*” He locates, as our argument based on the covenant *necessitates*, the Rest here on the earth. 
>(2) Then, without *any change* of meaning, he speaks of *the same Rest*, ch. 4:1, 3, etc., as promised also to us. 
>(3) If we take the rendering of verse 3, ch. 4, given by Bloomfield (after Kuin, Wets, and Schoettg.), Stuart, etc., then there is an evident admitted “*Jewish cast of reasoning*,” making the Sabbath typical. 
>(4) This is done, verse 4, where “*the seventh day*” is specially mentioned as a type. 
>(5) This same “*Rest*” is spoken of *as future*, v. 9. 
>(6) An important and significant change is observable in verses 9 and 10, for this “*Rest*” still in the future is called in the original “*Sabbatism*” (or marg. read. “Keeping of a Sabbath”), *thus endorsing the Jewish septenary or Millenaries*. Even Whitby, *Com. loci*, admits that the change from “Rest” to “Sabbatism” leads us “*to the spiritual Sabbath of which the Jewish doctors speak so generally as the great thing signified by their Sabbath*.” Commentators generally confess that allusion is made to the then existing view held by the Jews. What abundantly confirms this is the manner in which John introduces the one thousand years in Rev. 20. The Jewish notion of the septenary is *pointedly reproduced* by the Spirit, and referred to the future, being also connected with a resurrection. Now, it is impossible to conceive, if the Jewish idea of the Millenaries is an erroneous one, of *a more effectual way* of re-establishing and confirming the Jewish conceptions than is done in the Apocalyptic portrayal of the Millennium. This is fully evinced by the profound impression in this direction made upon the early churches. All this, however, only teaches us that, as the Jewish conception of the Kingdom was invariably identified with the future Sabbatism, the language of the apostles *indorsing* such a Sabbatism, is also *virtually the reception* of their doctrine of the Kingdom. Otherwise, the matter would have been explained, and a new meaning attached to it. But, seeing that the Covenant promises were linked with *the seventh Millenary* by the Jews, that they believed that David’s Son would inaugurate in His Kingdom *the Great Sabbath*, we may well contend that, as the apostles employ *the same phraseology* without the least hint of a change in meaning, that they also held to the fulfilment of the covenanted Kingdom *at that period*, or, to say the least, taught that such a Sabbath should, in the future, be witnessed here on earth, following regularly preceding ages.

### Almost universal agreement of an end within 6000 years
>Obs. 5. Another feature, which has materially served to perpetuate and enforce this Sabbatical view, is the following: Whatever application prophetical writers or commentators have made of the prophetical dates of Daniel and Revelation, which precede the ushering in of the Mill, era, they have been almost universally made to end within the 6000 years.
>p. 456 Vol. 2 Prop. 143 Obs. 5
### Something remarkable
>Obs. 6. There is something remarkable in the contrasts presented by this Sabbatism.
>p. 457 Vol. 2 Prop. 143 Obs. 6
### No need to press the chronology aspect
>Obs. 7. The student scarcely needs to be reminded that the Sabbatism presented needs not necessarily be pressed in its chronological aspect, although great stress has been laid on the same. For, so far as *our* argument is concerned (which is not a chronological one), it will be amply sufficient, if it be only conceded that the times, past and present, will be succeeded *here on earth* by another period containing this Sabbatism.
>p. 458 Vol. 2 Prop. 143 Obs. 7
### A few more illustrations
>Obs. 8. As indicative of the class of men who hold to this Sabbatism view, we present a few more illustrations. 
>1. Rothe (*Dog.*, P. 2, p. 60) says: “The Apostles describe the Chiliastic Kingdom. 
>2. Paul, in his letter to the Hebrews, calls it ‘*a Sabbatism*’ for the people of God.” 
>3. Archb. William Newcome (Bickersteth’s *Diss. on Proph.*, p. 106), referring to Rev. 20:4, and advocating our view of it, adds: “This is *the great Sabbatism* or rest of the Church.” 
>4. John Bunyan (*First Chaps. Genesis*) advocates “the glory that the Church shall have in the latter day, even in the seven thousandth year of the world, *that Sabbath* when Christ shall set up His Kingdom on earth.” 
>5. Hippolytus (Clarke’s *Ante-Nicene Ch. Lib.*, vol. 6, p. 447) remarks: “And 6000 years must needs be accomplished, in order that *the Sabbath* may come, the rest, the holy day, on which God rested from all His works. For the Sabbath is the type and emblem of the future Kingdom of the saints, when they shall reign with Christ, when He comes from heaven; 
>6. as John says in his Apocalypse: For a day with the Lord is as a thousand years.” 
>7. Gieseler (*Ch. His.*, vol. 1, p. 100), after stating the universality of Chiliasm in the second century, adds: “The Millennium was represented as the great Sabbath which was very soon to begin, and to be ushered in by the resurrection of the dead.”
