>Now, to return to the use made by Paul of this opinion entertained by the Jews. Brought up under Gamaliel, he must have known how the Jews regarded the Sabbath as typical of the reign of the Messiah, etc. Hence, the references made by him to this opinion, and their future application to Jesus Christ is a virtual endorsement of the same. We have, first, his declaration, Col. 2:16, 17, that “the Sabbaths are a shadow of things to come” viz., typical of things future as related to Christ. Second: the “Rest” which the Jews attributed to the Messianic reign, he applies, 2 Thess. 1:7, to the period of the future revelation of Jesus from heaven. The very phrase current to designate the Millennial glory (comp. Isa. 11:10), Paul refers to the Second Advent. Third: The manner in which he employs the word “Rest” in Hebrews, being addressed to Jews, could not but confirm them in their belief of the future reign of the Messiah during the seventh Millenary. (1) In chap. 3:11, 18 he calls the promised land, the land of Canaan, the covenanted land—the “Rest” He locates, as our argument based on the covenant necessitates, the Rest here on the earth. (2) Then, without any change of meaning, he speaks of the same Rest, ch. 4:1, 3, etc., as promised also to us. (3) If we take the rendering of verse 3, ch. 4, given by Bloomfield (after Kuin, Wets, and Schoettg.), Stuart, etc., then there is an evident admitted “Jewish cast of reasoning,” making the Sabbath typical. (4) This is done, verse 4, where “the seventh day” is specially mentioned as a type. (5) This same “Rest” is spoken of as future, v. 9. (6) An important and significant change is observable in verses 9 and 10, for this “Rest” still in the future is called in the original “Sabbatism” (or marg. read. “Keeping of a Sabbath”), thus endorsing the Jewish septenary or Millenaries. Even Whitby, Com. loci, admits that the change from “Rest” to “Sabbatism” leads us “to the spiritual Sabbath of which the Jewish doctors speak so generally as the great thing signified by their Sabbath.” Commentators generally confess that allusion is made to the then existing view held by the Jews. What abundantly confirms this is the manner in which John introduces the one thousand years in Rev. 20. The Jewish notion of the septenary is pointedly reproduced by the Spirit, and referred to the future, being also connected with a resurrection. Now, it is impossible to conceive, if the Jewish idea of the Millenaries is an erroneous one, of a more effectual way of re-establishing and confirming the Jewish conceptions than is done in the Apocalyptic portrayal of the Millennium. This is fully evinced by the profound impression in this direction made upon the early churches. All this, however, only teaches us that, as the Jewish conception of the Kingdom was invariably identified with the future Sabbatism, the language of the apostles endorsing such a Sabbatism, is also virtually the reception of their doctrine of the Kingdom. Otherwise, the matter would have been explained, and a new meaning attached to it. But, seeing that the Covenant promises were linked with the seventh Millenary by the Jews, that they believed that David’s Son would inaugurate in His Kingdom the Great Sabbath, we may well contend that, as the apostles employ the same phraseology without the least hint of a change in meaning, that they also held to the fulfilment of the covenanted Kingdom at that period, or, to say the least, taught that such a Sabbath should, in the future, be witnessed here on earth, following regularly preceding ages.
