# Proposition 205. The doctrine of the Kingdom materially aids us in preaching “the Christ”— the distinctive “Messiah.”

### Christ and Messiah are titles
>That “Christ” and “Messiah” are titular ascriptions, and not merely doctrinal words, has been already presented under Props. 153, Obs. 2 and 70, Obs. 11, and especially 199, Obs. 2. Many writers, some not in sympathy with us, fully indorse its Theocratic, Kingly title. The importance of this is so fully sustained by our entire argument, that a mere reference to some things pertaining to it is all that is necessary for a fitting conclusion, indicating how, by reason of a clearer conception of its meaning and design, it aids us in preaching “the Christ.”
>p. 567 Vol. 3 Prop. 205

>... the title will only become practically realized when, in “*the day of the Lord Jesus the Christ*" this Christ manifests the title in *the actual* Theocratic position occupied. When the Theocracy is re-established in power and glory, *then* the Messiah, the Christ, shines forth as the Anointed, the King in Israel, having obtained His appointed inheritance.
>p. 567 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 1
### Christship connected with the kingdom
>Christ is truly the Saviour, but it is in virtue of His Christship that He perfects Salvation; the Christship appertains to Him as a Person in a specified position. Rejecting the covenanted Kingdom, and receiving a purely Spiritual one, the title itself is correspondingly spiritualized and its ancient meaning discarded.
>p. 568 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 2
### Christ has deep meaning
>Van Oosterzee (*Ch. Dog.*, vol. 2, p. 527) forcibly says: “It (i.e. Messiah or Christ) is equivalent to saying that He is *the King of Israel*, promised in old times by the prophets, sent into the world by the Father, anointed with the Holy Ghost, and destined to rule forever over a Kingdom which is ever enduring.”
>p. 569 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 3
### Jesus condemned based on His Christship
>The condemnation of Jesus was based on His Christship, understood as the assumption of a Kingship.
>p. 570 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 4
### Name expressive of a real, literal Theocratic kingship
>... the Jews were correct in their idea that the name was expressive of a real, literal Theocratic Kingship.
>p. 570 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 4
### Disciples and apostles hold to his Kingship
>... the immediate disciples and apostles hold to this Messianic idea (i.e. Kingship over the restored Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom), as indicated by their preaching, etc.
>p. 572 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 5

>... “The apostles themselves held this opinion until after the resurrection of Christ,” Matt. 20:20, 21; Luke 24:21; Acts 1:6. The question arises, Were they mistaken in this idea? The majority of modern divines insist that they were mislead, over against the opinion of the early Church and others that they were not mistaken. If the former opinion is correct, then it involves the honesty and integrity of Jesus, viz., that He could deliberately allow —if the word Christ means no more than moderns assert—the disciples to be in ignorance on so important a point, being the heart of the Kingdom preached.
>p. 572 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 5

>In Matt. 16:16, Mark 8:20, and Luke 9:20, Peter, in answer to the question, “Whom say ye that I am?” answers; “*Thou art the Christ*.” Jesus replied that he was “blessed” because the Father had revealed this fact to him. Now, how could he be “blessed,” how could the matter be revealed to him, if he did not understand the meaning of “Christ?” That he comprehended it in the Jewish Theocratic sense is *self-evident* from e.g. Acts 1:6.
>p. 572-573 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 5
### Charged not to make Him known as "the Christ"
>Obs. 6. The student will also observe how often (as in connection with Peter’s confession, etc.) the disciples were charged *not to make Him known* as “the Christ.” . If “Christ” is merely “a doctrinal word,” no satisfactory reason can be given for this prohibition.
>p. 573 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 6

>... this prohibition extended only to the death of Jesus, because afterward it became the favorite title, seeing (1) that in view of His death it became essential to show that He was still “the Christ (2) that notwithstanding His death, faith in “the Christ” evinced hope in the ultimate fulfilment of covenant and prophecy pertaining to it; and (3) the death of Jesus would, owing to unbelief, enable the Christship to be proclaimed without the fear of being regarded in rebellion against the Roman Empire, for what could earthly Kingdoms fear from a dead, crucified Christ?
>p. 573 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 6
### Christ as "the King of kings"
>Obs. 8. Our whole argument shows that when He comes again, *He comes as “the Christ,*" the Anointed King who is to reign as David’s Son and Lord just as covenant and prophecy require.
>p. 575 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 8

>If there is a truth clearly taught in the Scriptures, it certainly is this one, that “the Christ” shall thus come and exhibit His mighty power and glory *as “Christ”* in delivering His people, punishing His enemies, and reigning gloriously as “the King of kings.”
>p. 575-576 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 8
### Kings of the earth oppose Him
>Obs. 9. The last opposition of the kings of the earth is against “*the Christ*," for they are “angry,” Rev. 11:18, that He comes to assert His covenanted claims. He comes (e.g. Rev. 19) as the King (i.e. the Christ), and “the Kings of the earth and their armies are gathered together to make war against Him.”
>p. 576 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 9

>As previously intimated, a comparison of Scripture indicates (Prop. 174, 180, etc.) that at the ending of this dispensation a knowledge of the Christship of Jesus and the claims of Kingship which it necessarily involves, will, more or less, be extended among the kings of the earth, and prove to be one, if not the chief, cause for the unrelenting hostility manifested against “the Christ.”
>p. 577 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 9
### Our hope depends on His Christship
>Obs. 10. This subject of the Christship is exceedingly important, for without it we could have no hope of the fulfilment of covenant and prophecy—of the Coming Kingdom and glory.
>p. 577 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 10

>... all our hopes of ultimate salvation, the restitution of all things, the blessedness and exceeding glory of the future Kingdom, depends upon the Christship of Jesus. It is as the Messiah that He comes to be the Saviour of the world, and, therefore, a proper conception of “the Christ,” is *a vital one* to a proper understanding of perfected Redemption. What “the Christ” has done in the past and present is only an earnest of what He will do for us when He is revealed as “the Christ” in Christly honor, regality, power, and glory.
>p. 577 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 10
### The subject of the first preachers
>Obs. 12. The preaching of the first preachers was that of “the Christ” (Acts 2:30, 31, 36; 3:20; 4:10; 5:42, etc.); Philip “preached Christ” and “the name of Jesus Christ” (Acts 8:5, 12); Paul “preached Christ” (Acts 9:20, 22); in brief, all did as Paul given in Acts 17:3, and 18:5, 28, and 19:4, and 20:21, and 28:31.
>p. 579 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 12

>We Millenarians are sometimes most unjustly charged as if we did not preach “*the Christ*,” when it is *a most vital point* in our system.—*fundamental* to the doctrine of the Kingdom, seeing that without “the Christ” the Kingdom is impossible.
>p. 579 Vol. 3 Prop. 205 Obs. 12
### Serious defects in "Lives of Christ" works
>Obs. 13. The doctrine of the Kingdom evinces the serious defects existing in numerous Lives of Christ. This is seen e.g. 
>1. in making “the Christ” a mere doctrinal word, 
>2. in misapprehending the Kingdom, 
>3. in substituting a Kingdom, 
>4. in invalidating the faith and preaching of the disciples, 
>5. in ignoring the Davidic covenant, 
>6. in overlooking the postponement, 
>7. in spiritualizing prophecies, 
>8. in misapplying the fulfilment of prediction, 
>9. in exaggerations of the design of the present dispensation, 
>10. in not evincing the relation that the First Advent sustains to the Second and its results, etc.
