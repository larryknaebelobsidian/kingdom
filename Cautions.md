I highly recommend any believer in Jesus Christ to read *The Theocratic Kingdom*. However, there are some things I wish to point out to my brothers and sisters in Christ that I find concerning and are due cautious study before quick acceptance.  Please consider that these are merely my personal views regarding some of the propositions George N. H. Peters makes in this masterful book.  I provide them to make it known that I do not recommend this book without cautions but this is true for any man made book. I have ordered these cautions according to Peters' propositions. I do not claim to have provided an exhaustive list of cautions.  The Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth.

Proposition 130. The Kingdom is preceded by a translation of the living saints.
>the Thessalonians believed “the day of Christ” to be already present, and his reasoning proceeds to show, not that saints are not to be raised and translated before that day (which is implied), but that before the day itself is ushered in as predicted, a visible Coming and the destruction of Antichrist must precede.

2 Thess. 2:1-3 says that "the day of the Lord has come" was the lie the Thessalonians were shaken over. Peters says that Paul's reasoning proceeds to show, not that "saints are not to be raised and translated before that day (which is implied), but that before the day itself is ushered in as predicted, a visible Coming and the destruction of Antichrist must precede."

Paul does not say that the resurrection and translation comes *before* that day, but *on* that day.

Peters states that the day cannot come until a visible coming of Christ and the Antichrist is destroyed.  Paul does not say this in Thessalonians.  Paul clearly says: 1. "The apostasy comes first" (2:3), 2. Then "the man of lawless is revealed" (2:3), 3. Then "the Lord will slay with the breath of his mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming" (2:8).

Therefore, Paul says
