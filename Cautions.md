I highly recommend any believer in Jesus Christ to read *The Theocratic Kingdom*. However, there are some things I wish to point out to my brothers and sisters in Christ that I find concerning and are due cautious study before quick acceptance.  Please consider that these are merely my personal views regarding some of the propositions George N. H. Peters makes in this masterful book.  I provide them to make it known that I do not recommend this book without cautions but this is true for any man made book. I have ordered these cautions according to Peters' propositions. I do not claim to have provided an exhaustive list of cautions.  The Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth.

## Proposition 130. The Kingdom is preceded by a translation of the living saints.
### Important Additions
>Obs. 1. While all writers on prophecy insist upon the translation of living saints at the Advent of Jesus, and the Millenarian authors direct especial attention to it; while it was a special object of hope and desire to the early believers and to succeeding ones, it is only more recently, since eschatology has received remarkable study and investigation, that *important additions* (resulting from comparing Scripture with Scripture) have been made to our knowledge respecting it. Our work would be incomplete without noticing this feature, and adding something to a subject imperfectly comprehended by many.
>p. 314 Vol. 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

The reader is cautioned to discern what in this proposition is primitive church belief and what is not.  
### The common view is now discarded as untenable
>the common view that the resurrection will be a public affair, to be witnessed by the world, is now discarded as untenable in the light of Christ’s (also pertaining to “the first-fruits”) resurrection, which was strictly private. It is now held, and properly, that the members will be raised *like* the Head was (for if a public resurrection, humanly speaking, is desirable, then surely it ought to nave been that of Christ’s), in order that the preparatory events for the coming judgment of the world may be introduced in such a manner (privately) as to establish “*the snare*” and “*the net*” intended for the unbelieving and wicked. Leading prophetical writers justly have no hesitancy in asserting that no mortal eye of unbelief shall behold the resurrection. This at once places the translation of the saints in a new aspect, and indicates, as it accompanies the resurrection, that it also is unseen (like Enoch’s and Elijah’s) by the world.
>p. 314-315 Vol. 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

Was the "common view" that Peters says has now been "discarded as untenable", the chiliast view?

Reasons the "common view" has now been "discarded as untenable":
1. Christ's own resurrection was private
2. This private nature of the resurrection of the saints establishes "the snare" and "the net" intended for the unbelieving and wicked.
3. Leading prophetical writers assert that no mortal eye of unbelief shall behold the resurrection
4. Unseen by the world like Enoch's and Elijah's

### Private then Public resurrection
In proposition 130 Peters makes these unusual points:
- The resurrection of the saints has a private and public aspect
	- This point seems to have come to light during Peters' day and not as a belief of the primitive church (not chiliasm)
- The resurrection and translation is to happen **before** the day of Christ
	- However, Scripture places them **on** the day of Christ

Proposition 130. The Kingdom is preceded by a translation of the living saints.
>the Thessalonians believed “the day of Christ” to be already present, and his reasoning proceeds to show, not that saints are not to be raised and translated before that day (which is implied), but that before the day itself is ushered in as predicted, a visible Coming and the destruction of Antichrist must precede.

2 Thess. 2:1-3 says that "the day of the Lord has come" was the lie the Thessalonians were shaken over. Peters says that Paul's reasoning proceeds to show, not that "saints are not to be raised and translated before that day (which is implied), but that before the day itself is ushered in as predicted, a visible Coming and the destruction of Antichrist must precede."

Paul does not say that the resurrection and translation comes *before* that day, but *on* that day.

Peters states that the day cannot come until a visible coming of Christ and the Antichrist is destroyed.  Paul does not say this in Thessalonians.  Paul clearly says: 1. "The apostasy comes first" (2:3), 2. Then "the man of lawless is revealed" (2:3), 3. Then at some indefinite time after the man of lawlessness is revealed, it is he whom "the Lord will slay with the breath of his mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming" (2:8).

"The coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him" in 2:1 is the same as "the day of the Lord" in 2:2.

Therefore, Paul says Christ comes on "the day of the Lord" when He will destroy Antichrist. And Paul also says that "the day of the Lord" will not come until the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed.

The revealing of the lawless one will not come until "he who now restrains is taken out of the way" (2:7).

Paul
apostasy
restrainer taken out of the way
man of lawlessness revealed
Day of the Lord - Christ comes (resurrection and translation) and slays the man of lawlessness

Peters
Resurrection and Translation
Visible coming of Christ
Antichrist destroyed
Day of the Lord

### Time between private and public perhaps 7 years, 40 years, 70 (30+40) years ...

### Translation is a rescue of living saints from great tribulation

### Removal for deliverance and preparation

### Begins in the night

### FOR and WITH

### Partial

### Hiding

### Translation will be unwitnessed but know to the nations

### Multiple translations

Peters believes that the majority of Christians (but not all) will be left behind to experience the tribulation

### Restrainer

### Two translations


## Proposition 166
### Raptured up into the clouds then to Mt. Sinai, not heaven

Proposition 166. The rudimentary reorganization of this Kingdom will be made at Mt. Sinai.

The private resurrection and translation takes believers to Mt. Sinai to ready them for the Day of Christ (public)

### Removal to Mt. Sinai for deliverance and preparation

## Proposition 195
### Government of other worlds
Proposition 195. This doctrine of the Kingdom may, analogically give in a clew to the Government of other worlds.
