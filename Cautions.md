I highly recommend any believer in Jesus Christ to read *The Theocratic Kingdom*. However, there are some things I wish to point out to my brothers and sisters in Christ that I find concerning and are due cautious study before quick acceptance.  Please consider that these are merely my personal views regarding some of the propositions George N. H. Peters makes in this masterful book.  I provide them to make it known that I do not recommend this book without cautions but this should be true for any man-made book. I have ordered these cautions according to Peters' propositions. I do not claim to have provided an exhaustive list of cautions.  The Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth.
