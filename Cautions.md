I highly recommend any believer in Jesus Christ to read *The Theocratic Kingdom*. However, there are some things I wish to point out to my brothers and sisters in Christ that I find concerning and are due cautious study before quick acceptance.  Please consider that these are merely my personal views regarding some of the propositions George N. H. Peters makes in this masterful book.  I provide them to make it known that I do not recommend this book without cautions but this is true for any man made book. I have ordered these cautions according to Peters' propositions. I do not claim to have provided an exhaustive list of cautions.  The Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth.

## Proposition 130
### Private then Public resurrection
In proposition 130 Peters makes these unusual points:
- The resurrection of the saints has a private and public aspect
	- This point seems to have come to light during Peters' day and not as a belief of the primitive church (not chiliasm)
- The resurrection and translation is to happen **before** the day of Christ
	- However, Scripture places them **on** the day of Christ

Proposition 130. The Kingdom is preceded by a translation of the living saints.
>the Thessalonians believed “the day of Christ” to be already present, and his reasoning proceeds to show, not that saints are not to be raised and translated before that day (which is implied), but that before the day itself is ushered in as predicted, a visible Coming and the destruction of Antichrist must precede.

2 Thess. 2:1-3 says that "the day of the Lord has come" was the lie the Thessalonians were shaken over. Peters says that Paul's reasoning proceeds to show, not that "saints are not to be raised and translated before that day (which is implied), but that before the day itself is ushered in as predicted, a visible Coming and the destruction of Antichrist must precede."

Paul does not say that the resurrection and translation comes *before* that day, but *on* that day.

Peters states that the day cannot come until a visible coming of Christ and the Antichrist is destroyed.  Paul does not say this in Thessalonians.  Paul clearly says: 1. "The apostasy comes first" (2:3), 2. Then "the man of lawless is revealed" (2:3), 3. Then at some indefinite time after the man of lawlessness is revealed, it is he whom "the Lord will slay with the breath of his mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming" (2:8).

"The coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him" in 2:1 is the same as "the day of the Lord" in 2:2.

Therefore, Paul says Christ comes on "the day of the Lord" when He will destroy Antichrist. And Paul also says that "the day of the Lord" will not come until the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed.

The revealing of the lawless one will not come until "he who now restrains is taken out of the way" (2:7).

Paul
apostasy
restrainer taken out of the way
man of lawlessness revealed
Day of the Lord - Christ comes (resurrection and translation) and slays the man of lawlessness

Peters
Resurrection and Translation
Visible coming of Christ
Antichrist destroyed
Day of the Lord

### Time between private and public perhaps 7 years, 40 years, 70 (30+40) years ...

### Translation is a rescue of living saints from great tribulation

### Removal for deliverance and preparation

### Begins in the night

### FOR and WITH

### Partial

### Hiding

### Translation will be unwitnessed but know to the nations

### Multiple translations

Peters believes that the majority of Christians (but not all) will be left behind to experience the tribulation

### Restrainer

### Two translations


## Proposition 166
### Raptured up into the clouds then to Mt. Sinai, not heaven

Proposition 166. The rudimentary reorganization of this Kingdom will be made at Mt. Sinai.

The private resurrection and translation takes believers to Mt. Sinai to ready them for the Day of Christ (public)

### Removal to Mt. Sinai for deliverance and preparation

## Proposition 195
### Government of other worlds
Proposition 195. This doctrine of the Kingdom may, analogically give in a clew to the Government of other worlds.
