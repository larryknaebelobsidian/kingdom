### Analogy of Scripture
>Obs. 1. In relation to the analogy of Scripture, which exhibits a general connection and agreement subsisting between the truths contained in Holy Scripture, such connection and correspondence is strikingly manifested. Thus we have 
>1. first the covenant with its promises; 
>2. then a Theocracy with a special ordering growing out of it; 
>3. then the amplification of this covenant with David, owing to the foreseen fall; 
>4. then the overthrow of the Theocratic Kingdom on account of sinfulness; 
>5. then the prophetic announcements, based on the covenants, of the restoration of this Theocratic Kingdom (under a new arrangement) by David’s Son and Lord; 
>6. then the First Advent of the promised Messiah, David’s Son, and the tender of this Kingdom on condition of repentance; 
>7. then the rejection of it by the nation and the atoning death of Jesus, with the postponement of the Kingdom to the Sec. Advent; 
>8. then, to provide a seed for Abraham, the call of the Jews and Gentiles; 
>9. the establishment of the Chr. Church; 
>10. the connection that this Church sustains to the postponed Kingdom; 
>11. the relation that the Messiah maintains toward it; 
>12. the assurances that we have in Christ’s ability in virtue of His death, resurrection, and exaltation to fulfil the covenanted promises; 
>13. the fulfilment of covenant and promises at the Sec. Advent; 
>14. the condition of the Church during this intermediate period, and 
>15. the attitude of nations during the Times of the Gentiles—
>are all given, so unmistakably and connectedly by the different writers, as to form a complete chain, one link firmly fastened to another.

### Analogy of Faith
>Obs. 2. The Analogy of Faith (closely allied with the preceding) deals more with the connection that one doctrine sustains to another and to the whole system of truth, or to the great end designed in Redemption.
### Analogy of Tradition
>Obs. 3. Subordinately, we also introduce the Analogy of Tradition, seeing that some lay so much stress upon tradition, and which, to a certain extent, is reasonable and allowable.
>...
>the Analogy of Tradition, by which we mean that it accurately agrees with the teaching and tradition of the Church in the formation and primitive period (Props. 74, 75, 76, 77, 78).
### Petrine, Pauline, Johannine theologies view is wrong
>Obs. 4. The doctrine of the Kingdom, supported by the analogies of Scripture, faith, and tradition, utterly repudiates the insidious, extreme theory of Petrine, Pauline, and Johannine theologies, the one following the other in course of development.

>This is advocated in order to strengthen the departure of more modern thought from the Primitive Church position. It has no foundation, in fact, Scripturally or historically, and is an idea broached by Joachim, in his famous prophecies, making Peter, Paul, and John the representatives of successive periods, and now pressed into service to indicate how, by way of apology for the change, the Church came to be removed from the early belief on this and kindred subjects.

### Shows the hand of God - Divine Purpose
>Obs. 5. In view of these analogies confirming the doctrine of the Kingdom, we may well ask whether this mutual relationship of doctrine, gradually bestowed, given by various writers in different ages, and yet evincing an intimate connection, necessary for a continuous and harmonious Plan, was merely accidental? Can such a remarkable correspondence, attested to at every step historically, in upholding and developing the establishment of such a Kingdom, be accounted for in any other way than that it is the Divine Purpose, as stated in the covenants and prophets, to accomplish it?

>the reasons why the covenant promises were not realized at the First Advent are prominently given in the New Test., but which such writers conveniently ignore, just as if they were not also recorded.
