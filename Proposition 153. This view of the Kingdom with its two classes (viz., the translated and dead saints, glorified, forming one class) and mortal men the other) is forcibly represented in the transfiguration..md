### Transfiguration is a representation of the Kingdom in some of its aspects

>The transfiguration, following the announcement that “some” should, before their death, see “the Son of man Coming in His Kingdom,” is *a representation of the Kingdom* in some of its aspects, viz., *in the glory of* “*the Christ*” *or King, in the presence of* (who also “appeared in glory,” Luke 9:31) *the translated and dead saints, and in the witnessing of that glory by mortal men*. It was a temporary display, an outward manifestation or revealing of the majesty and glory *that belongs* to Jesus when He comes *at the Second Advent in His Kingdom* with His saints to reign over the nations.
>p. 559-560 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 4

### Moses represents resurrected saints
### Elijah represents translated saints

>Moses represents the body of saints who have died, but who will also be glorified with Christ; and as he was in converse with the glorified Saviour, so will they also be in nearness to Him. Moses and Elias both appearing “in glory,” seems to indicate the same glorification of body. Elias represents another body, who, like himself, shall not fall “asleep,” but shall be translated without experiencing the power of death. These two, the dead and the living, who shall be glorified at the Coming of Jesus, are graphically portrayed in 1 Cor. 15:51, 52, and 1 Thess. 4:15-17. These not only *see* His glory, but *partake* of the same, 1 Jno. 3:2; Phil. 3:21, etc., for of them it is said: “*When Christ*” (notice, as “Christ”), “*who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory*, Col. 3:4.

### Peter, James, John represent unglorified, mortal men

>But in addition to these, we have, to meet the prophetic announcements and to fill out the representation, *three persons*, Peter, James, and John, *unglorified, mortal men living on the earth*, who see this glorified Christ and His glorified associates, and are so deeply impressed, so delighted with *the exceeding glory* revealed, that through the spokesman Peter, the emphatic declaration is made: “*Lord, it is good for us to be here*.”
