# Proposition 84. As this Kingdom is specially given to the Son of Man as the result of his obedience, sufferings, and death, it must be something different from His Divine nature, or from “piety,” “religion,” “God’s reign in the heart” etc.

>Our argument all along involves this, for we have (1) the Kingdom promised to David’s Son; (2) this promise based on the foretold affirmations that this Son shall be spotless, without sin; and (3) the continued blessedness and perpetuity of the Kingdom asserted in view of the perfect character of this descendant of David. Numerous passages declare this; hence, when we come to the Apostles, they plainly inform us that His exaltation and reception of dominion is due to His obedience, sufferings, and death. Two passages alone clearly present this to us, viz.: Heb. 12:2; Phil. 2:8, 9. The latter part of the Proposition follows as a natural sequence.
### Jesus life and death confirms His right and title
>Obs. 1. The first clause of the Proposition is fully admitted by Commentators (as e.g. Barnes, etc.), and by Theologians (as e.g. Knapp, Ch. Theol., p. 351 and 355), as “acquired,” so that in the language of Knapp, “He received it (the government) from His Father as a reward for His sufferings, and for his faithful performance of the whole work, and discharge of all the offices entrusted to Him by God for the good of man.”
>...
>It is the distinctive Son of David to whom this Kingdom belongs by covenanted Divine right. He only confirms His right and title to it, as the Representative Ruler in such a Theocratic Kingdom, by the life and death which He manifested.
### The Kingdom is not piety or reign in the heart
>Obs. 2. Some of the most eminent writers and commentators not knowing how to escape the dilemmas incident to their theory of a present existing Kingdom of promise, gravely tell us that this Kingdom is “piety,” or “religion” or the most favorite phrase (as e.g. Dr. McCosh, and others), “God’s reign in the heart.”
>...
>why not then date the Kingdom from Adam down to the present, seeing that “piety” or “religion,” or “God’s reign in the heart,” has existed continuously?
>...
>Piety, religion, etc., are prerequisites to attain to this Kingdom, and are to exist in the Kingdom itself, but are far from constituting the Kingdom.
### Some Jews had piety but no kingdom
>Obs. 3. The tender of the Kingdom to the Jewish nation, its rejection, postponement, the peculiar style of preaching of the first preachers—all go to show that “piety,” etc. existed with a certain portion of the Jews, without the establishment of the Kingdom.

### Example of wrong teaching
Obs. 4
### Perfect adaptability for the Ruler position
>Obs. 5. This evinces what the covenant, etc., demands, viz.: a Ruler, who is such in virtue also of His humanity; and includes, that this Ruler has shown what no other Theocratic Ruler can do, His perfect adaptability for the position, i.e. to carry out the Divine Will in government. Keeping in view the goal of Theocratic government and its requirements, we find in the honorable obedience of Christ the most ample and satisfactory assurance that in His occupancy of the Davidic throne and Kingdom, He will indeed be a truthful and stable Representative of God. Therefore Peter says, 1 Pet. 1:21, etc.
