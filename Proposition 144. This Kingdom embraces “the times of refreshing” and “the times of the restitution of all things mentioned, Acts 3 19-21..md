>Acts 3:19-21 (LSB)
>Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord; 20 and that He may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you, 21 whom heaven must receive until _the_ period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time.

>Obs. 1. Before entering into a discussion, the reader is exhorted to notice that Peter is addressing Jews who were familiar with, and employed, the phraseology used.

>If the predicted refreshing and restitution under the Messiah was, as modern writers tell us, to be experienced in this dispensation, why is it that the faith and hope of the Early Church was so constantly directed to the speedy Second Advent? Consistency and the preservation of the integrity of the early faith, covenant and prophecy, all require us to receive those expressions as still relating to the future.
>Obs. 1

>Obs. 2. Notice the meaning of “the times of refreshing.” Barnes (Com. loci) tells us that “refreshing means properly the breathing or refreshment after being heated with labor, running, etc; hence denotes any kind of refreshment, as rest, or deliverance from evils of any kind.” He speaks of “the common belief of the Jews” concerning it, and adds: “The idea, however, that the times of the Messiah would be times of rest, and ease, and prosperity, was a favorite one among the Jews, and was countenanced in the Old Test. See Isa. 28:12,

>Life in this sinful world is conceived as a time of conflict and distress, and it is followed by rest in the Kingdom of the Messiah. The phrase is only to be found in this passage of the New Test., and has but feeble parallels in the Old Test., as e.g. 2 Sam. 23:7.
>Obs. 2

>Obs. 4. While the view of restitution, embracing the restoration of the Theocracy and the return to the condition of things before the fall of Adam; is consoling and grand, yet even this would limit its meaning, for a more sublime and scriptural aspect of it is, that, while including those mentioned, it is a restoration to that very condition which Adam and his descendants would have attained to had they not fallen.
>...
>Hence in some of its aspects, transcending all experience and knowledge, it may be beyond our comprehension; at least, the Bible intimates in a number of places that it is scarcely possible for us now, situated as we are, to form adequate conceptions of its extent and glory.

>Obs. 5. Again, let it be distinctly understood that Jesus “the Christ” is the Refresher or Reanimator, the Restorer, the Mighty Deliverer.

>This power and honor He has delegated to no one in this future dispensation (whatever the glorified saints may, associated with Him, perform through Him in the world to come), and He justly claims that it belongs to Himself exclusively, as e.g. “Behold, I make all things new,” etc.
>Obs. 5

>Before restitution comes, Jesus must first come; this is the divine order plainly laid down.
>Obs. 5

>Obs. 6. As various writers (e.g. Lord, Judge Jones, Brookes, Bickersteth, etc.) have intimated, these “times” may include successive eras, economies, ascending stages of glory.

>While the Millennium is thus, in a manner, initiatory to succeeding dispensations or ages, yet, as we shall show hereafter (Prop. 159), the restitution thus affected is not displaced by another one, for it is always spoken of as eternal (see Prop. 159).
>Obs. 6

>it is proper for us to avoid giving, what can only be conjecture, any decisive opinion concerning the phraseology which seems to involve a succession of eras in the continuation of a restored world.
>Obs. 6

>Dr. Craven (Lange’s Com. Rev., p. 339) gives an interesting note on this passage, well worthy of notice. He refers to the plural “times” as indicative of lengthened period (to which we also attach the idea of successive stages or periods), and fully advocates our position. We give this extract: “The following seem to be the elements of the restitution predicted in the foregoing Scriptures: 
>1. A restoration of the hearts of the fathers to the children, Mai. 4:6. 
>2. The restoration of the rejected seed of Jacob to holiness and the subsequent favor of God, Isa. 1:25; Jer. 24:7. 
>3. The restoration of Israel to their own land, passim. 
>4. The establishment of Israel not again to be dispersed, Jer. 24:6, 7. 
>5. The establishment of the Kingdom of righteousness as a visible Kingdom, in power and great glory, with its seat at Jerusalem, Isa. 1:25, 26 (2:2,.3); 58:12-14; Jer. 23:5-8; 23:7 sqq. 
>6. The gathering of all nations as tributary to Israel or the Church. 
>7. The Palingenesis, Isa. 11; 65:17 sqq.”
