>Acts 3:19-21
>Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord; 20 and that He may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you, 21 whom heaven must receive until _the_ period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time.
