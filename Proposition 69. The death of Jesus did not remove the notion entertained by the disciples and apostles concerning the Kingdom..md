>It is asserted in numerous works that the death of Jesus caused such an immediate revolution in the minds of the disciples that it destroyed all their anticipations of the expected restored Davidic Kingdom. This is done without due reflection, seeing that it is opposed by the plainest statement.
### Resurrection proved His ability to restore the kingdom
>Obs. 1. It is true that the death of Jesus (notwithstanding the intimations previously given, as seen in Props. 58, 66, etc.) must have placed them in a perplexed attitude, and must, before His resurrection, have appeared contradictory to their expectations.
>...
>the question would naturally arise, how can this Kingdom be established when the King, David’s Son, Himself yields to death?
>...
>the resurrection, restoring the Messiah to them, reconfirmed that faith in His ability, etc. to fulfil the covenants and Prophets, so that it ever after shone forth with undiminished strength and lustre.
### No indication found in the record
>Obs. 2. If writers are correct in their deductions of the effects of Christ’s death in revolutionizing the minds of the disciples, then there ought to be —if it was a result intended by Divine Providence—a distinct announcement of the same in the New Test. We ought to find (1) that they had been mistaken in their previous apprehensions of the Kingdom, and (2) that the death of Jesus and events following indicated this to them. But nothing of this kind is found in the record, and we are not at liberty to infer it.
### Acts 1:3,6 Proof passage
>Obs. 3. For the present it is sufficient to produce a single passage which amply proves our Proposition; others will be added as we proceed. The death of Jesus took place; His resurrection occurred; He remained after His resurrection with those previously sent-forth preachers of the Kingdom “forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God” (Acts 1:3). It is exceedingly difficult to conceive, when the Kingdom was the principal topic of conversation, that if these apostles were still ignorant of the very nature of the Kingdom and Christ’s death was to be the medium for their enlightenment, some decided information to remove the alleged “error” was not granted to them during these forty days. The tenor of the narrative shows that in all their conversations respecting the Kingdom nothing was said that changed the faith of the apostles. They still need the belief that they had authoritatively preached. The proof is found in the question (v. 6), “Lord, wilt Thou at this time restore again the Kingdom to Israel?” This is admitted by all—very reluctantly indeed by some commentators and writers—to mean that they still believed in a restoration of the Davidic throne and Kingdom under the reign of the Messiah. The reply of Jesus, as we already had occasion to observe, confirms their belief; for instead of rejecting their idea of the nature of the kingdom, He takes that for granted as substantially correct, and only refers to the time when it should again be restored to Israel as something reserved by the Father, thus meeting the question proposed which related to the time.
### Kingdom was not already established in the ministry of Jesus
>Obs. 4. The conversation between Jesus and the disciples pertaining to the Kingdom, and the question of the latter just before the ascension, most effectually disproves the assertions of eminent writers that the Kingdom was already established sometime in the ministry or life of Jesus (Prop. 56).
