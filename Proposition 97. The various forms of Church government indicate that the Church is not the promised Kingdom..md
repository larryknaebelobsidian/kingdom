# Proposition 97. The various forms of Church government indicate that the Church is not the promised Kingdom.

>Taking the prophetic record, which gives the Messianic Kingdom a uniform government with a uniform faith, it is impossible to accept of the church, with its diversified forms of government, as an intended exhibit of the Kingdom.
### Church not founded with fixed form of government
>Obs. 1. While men differ in their interpretation of the church, yet it is generally admitted, excepting by the Roman Catholics and a High-Church party, that Christ did not found His church with an accurately affined and fixed form of government for its associated capacity, but left the forms it should assume in society, and among nations, to the development made by Providence and human agency.
>...
>The very design of the church does not require such a government, it being fully met by the simple organization, few rites, sacraments, worship, and rules which are given.

### Many shapes and sizes of current church government
Obs. 2
>Obs. 2. Some hold that by virtue of the church being a Kingdom, Christ rules over it by a vicegerent (i.e. the Pope); others, by a divinely appointed and regularly descended Episcopacy; some, by the rules of the State, forming State religions; others, by the ministry and officers of the congregation; some, by individual congregations who in the aggregate form the Kingdom; others, by General Councils, Conferences, Assemblies, or Synods; and others, by the associated union of the civil power with the church either as primary or subordinate. There is a variety to suit all inclinations.
