>God is not indifferent to the establishment of this Theocratic Kingdom, and His divine oversight respecting it is constantly made manifest, e.g. in the selection, training, and covenant with Abraham, in the selection, adoption, and covenant with David, in the selection of Mary and the birth of Jesus, in the announcements made of His Purpose, in the provisions established to carry out to ultimate completion the Theocratic conception.
### God is personally interested
>Obs. 1. God has 
>1. a Divine Sovereignty and exercises it (Props. 79, so); 
>2. a definite Divine Purpose and will perform it (Isa. 14:26, 27); 
>3. a predetermined Theocratic Plan, which will be accomplished (Prop. 2); 
>4. oath-bound designs, which will be realized (Prop. 50); 
>5. an omnipotence in Providence that is irresistible (Jer. 18:2—G); 
>6. an end in view that will result according to His will (Horn. 9:9-21). 
>From the beginning to the end of this doctrine, as given in Scripture, from the inception of the Theocratic idea to its final perfect realization, God stands before us as One who personally interested in the matter, and who, for the sake of His own honor, praise, and glory, overrules all to bring forth, at the appointed time, a glorious consummation that shall vindicate and embellish the Divine perfections enlisted and employed in this grand redemptive work.

>4. the history of Joseph; 
>5. the removal from Egypt; 
>6. the establishment of a Theocratic Kingdom; 
>7. the varied transactions of that Kingdom;

>9. the raising up of prophets; 
>10. the removal of the Theocracy; 
>11. the provisions made for its re-establishment; 
>12. the rejection of the nation; 
>13. the call of the Gentiles; 
>14. the destruction of Jerusalem, and 
>15. in hundreds of particulars; so much so that the student of the Theocratic Plan is constantly impressed with it, and feels it to be a living reality in which he can evermore trustingly confide.

### Special providence of God
>Obs. 3. The special Providence of God is most remarkably enforced and illustrated 
>1. in the birth and life of David’s Son, and 
>2. in the continuous provision made for the future re-establishment of the Theocracy under the supervision of this Son and His associated rulers. It is seen 
>3. in the striking acts of that life and its results; it is witnessed 
>4. in the perpetuation of the Church by which a people are gathered out for the Kingdom; it is seen 
>5. in the qualified and waiting King; it is witnessed 
>6. in the people, designed for associated rulers, 
>7. in the process of formation. 
>8. The announcement, 
>9. the star,
>10. the birth, 
>11. the flight to Egypt—all in 
>12. the life, 
>13. the death, 
>14. burial, 
>15. resurrection, and 
>16. ascension of this covenanted seed proclaim it; 
>17. the call of the apostles, 
>18. the founding of the Church, 
>19. the gathering out of the nations—all in 
>20. the work of procuring co-heirs with the Christ, announce it. 
>We behold this Providence encircling us, embracing us, aiding us, elevating us, and finally crowning us.
