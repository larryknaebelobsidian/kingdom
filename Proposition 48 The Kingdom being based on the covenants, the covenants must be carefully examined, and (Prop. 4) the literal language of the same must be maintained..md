>The appointment, arrangement, disposition, or institution of a covenant relation, in whatever (as voluntary, a contract, etc.) light it may be regarded, presupposes two parties; the one who promises or imparts, and the other who will receive or attains. In all earthly transactions, when a promise, agreement, or contract is entered into by which one party gives a promise of value to another, it is *universally* the custom to explain such a relationship and its promises *by the well-known laws of language* contained in our grammars or in common usage. It would be regarded absurd and trifling to view them in any other light. (Comp. Prop. 4.)
>p. 290 Vol. 1 Prop. 48

### Obs. 3

>Our Proposition is confirmed by the indisputable fact that God has stamped the grammatical sense as the correct one by *literally fulfilling* a portion of the covenants.
>p. 291 Vol. 1 Prop. 48 Obs. 3

### Obs. 4

>The promises in the covenants are *not typical* . . .
>The *partial fulfilment* of them clearly shows that they are not to be regarded as typical.
