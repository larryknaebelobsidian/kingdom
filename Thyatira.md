### The Judge
The Son of God
- who has eyes like a flame of fire
- feet like burnished bronze

### The Considerations
I know
- your deeds
- your love
- your faith
- your service
- your perseverence
- your deeds of late are greater than at first

### The Judgement
You tolerate the woman Jezebel
	- calls herself a prophetess
	- teaches and leads my slaves astray so they commit acts of immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols
	- I gave her time to repent
		- She does not want to repent of her immorality

### The Penalty
- Judge will throw her on a bed of sickness
- Judge will throw those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent
- Judge will kill her children with pestilence and all churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts
- Judge will give to each one of you according to your deeds

### Call to Action
- The others in the church of Thyatira who do not hold this teaching - no burden on you
- what you have hold fast till I come

### The Reward
He who overcomes and keeps my deeds until the end
	- Judge will give authority over the nations to rule them with a rod of iron
	- Judge will give him the morning star

***He who has a ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches***
