[[Abrahamic Covenant]]
#toc 

There are 24 observations in this proposition.

>The covenant of this dispensation, called the New Testament, or the New Covenant, is none other than the Abrahamic *renewed or confirmed* by Jesus the Christ. We are not left to conjecture or inference on so important a point; it is one *plainly taught* in Holy Writ.
>p. 320 Vol. 1 Prop 50 Obs. 1

>. . . Gentiles come in *under the Abrahamic covenant* . . .
>p. 320 Vol. 1 Prop 50 Obs. 2

>Persons are apt to be misled by the use of the word “*new*,” thinking that it necessarily means something entirely new, different from what preceded. They forget that in Bible usage it frequently means *renewed, restored again, newly confirmed*, etc., as in new heart, new moon, new creature, new heavens and new earth, now commandment, drink new (Matt. 26:29), etc. It is important then to discriminate whenever the word is employed, especially in so weighty a matter as this, seeing *the high interests* that are involved. As the phrase “new covenant” only appears once in the Old Test, and but a few times in the New, the general analogy of Scripture must be allowed to determine the sense in which it is used.
>p. 323 Vol. 1 Prop 50 Obs. 4

>. . . *the very engrafting or adoption* of Gentile believers into the covenanted, elect nation, is itself evidence that *we live under the reconfirmed* Abrahamic covenant. . . .
>p. 324 Vol. 1 Prop 50 Obs. 5

>. . . a correct knowledge of covenant relationship is essential to *a proper understanding* of the truth in Redemption, and to inspire within us *correct hopes* of the future, . . .
>p. 324 Vol. 1 Prop 50 Obs. 5

>This view of the covenant was overshadowed and crushed by the Alexandrian, monkish, and Popish theories introduced (comp. Props. 77 and 78). It was entertained in some of its leading aspects by a few (as e.g. Waldenses, Albigenses) down to the Reformation, when it was partially (not in its primitive purity) revived by the Reformers. 
>. . . every Reformer saw and recognized the *fundamental* character of the Abrahamic covenant, that we lived under its promises, that Christ made provision for their fulfilment, and thus confirmed the covenant. . . .
>p. 324 Vol. 1 Prop 50 Obs. 6

>There are writers who clearly apprehend the truth and fairly state it. These, of course, are Millenarians; for it is *a distinguishing feature* of their system, from the Primitive Church down, that it is *directly founded on the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants*. Holding to those covenants *as written*, clinging to those promises *without changing* them, believing that they will *all, as recorded*, be finally realized through Jesus Christ,— *leads necessarily to Chiliasm*.
>p. 326 Vol. 1 Prop 50 Obs. 8

>. . . Christ is “the highest and last representative of the Abrahamic covenant.” *No! never*! for the covenant *comprehends immensely more* than the incarnation of the Messiah; it embraces His inheritance and future glory; it is world-embracing, for, as will be shown hereafter, in its brief but pregnant sentences, it includes the resurrection, restoration, and inheriting of the Patriarchs and of their believing descendants and of the adopted seed,—the Kingdom under the reign of that pre-eminent Seed, the ultimate salvation of the race as a race, the final removal of the curse, and the perfected Redemption of man and the creation. The Incarnation, *inexpressibly precious and indispensably necessary*, is an important—the first in magnitude— *means for the accomplishment of covenant promises*, but it too is *only preparatory*. Hence it is wrong to narrow down the covenant to the First Advent, just as if the Seed was not in *His glorified humanity* (comp. e.g. Props. 82, 83, 199-203) yet to exhibit a glorious part in the fulfilment of covenanted promises at *His Second Advent*.
>p. 328 Vol. 1 Prop 50 Obs. 10

>The very coming of the Seed covenanted to Abraham, insures the fulfilment of the covenant as written. It is in view of this that He Himself is designated “the covenant ,” for He is the Fulfiller of it, and without Him it could not possibly be realized. Justin Martyr (Dial, with Trypho, ch. 51) and others of the Fathers, who viewed the covenant in the light that we do, called Christ “the New Testament,” meaning that in Him the covenant was confirmed and fully assured of ultimate fulfilment. The Advent of Abraham’s Seed, then, is evidence already that the purposes of God expressed in that covenant are sure. Literally He came, vindicating the truthfulness of the covenant given many centuries before, and teaching us, if we .will but receive it, that every promise will be literally verified.
