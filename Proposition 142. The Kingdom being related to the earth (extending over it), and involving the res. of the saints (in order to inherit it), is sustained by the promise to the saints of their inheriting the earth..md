# Proposition 142. The Kingdom being related to the earth (extending over it), and involving the res. of the saints (in order to inherit it), is sustained by the promise to the saints of their inheriting the earth.
### The meek shall inherit the earth
>Obs. 2. The declaration of Jesus, Matt. 5:5, that the meek shall inherit the earth, ought to be decisive. But men under the influence of a plastic system of interpretation, urged on by a preconceived notion, leave the plain meaning of the promise and explain it away.

>Let the reader turn to Psalm 37, where this same promise is repeated five times, and he will find it in vs. 9, 11, 22, 29, 34,
>Obs. 1

>Obs. 3. Attention is again called to the confirmation our doctrine receives from the alleged omission of any but earthly blessings promised to believers in the Mosaic record, and long after.

>Let, however, the entire scope of the Bible speak; let Moses, David, Paul, let all speak; let covenant and covenant promises declare what is this promised inheritance, and in perfect harmony each and every one, proclaim it to be the inheriting of the land, of the earth, of the world, and the possessing of it for the ages. There is nothing hidden in these promises; they mean precisely what the words in their general usage indicate. Moses promises not merely, if the people are obedient, a temporal possession of the land, but a perpetual one. Those who died are still promised the same, implying a triumph over death and the grave; and, what ought to suffice, the assurance that God’s promises would, in this respect, be faithfully realized, is the golden chain which binds Moses, Prophets, Jesus, Apostles, pious Jews, Apostolic Fathers, and other worthies to hold that the time will most certainly arrive when all the meek shall inherit the earth.
>Obs. 3

>All such criticisms arise from making more of the intermediate state than the Bible warrants. If the pious dead are rewarded, crowned, inherit (Prop. 136), etc., as Popery and some Protestantism make it, then there would be some propriety in the objection.
>Obs.  4

>Obs. 5. Truth demands the correction of esteemed writers, such as Jones, Shimeall, Butler and others, he make this inheritance to extend to the possession of other worlds, or the third heaven, or the Universe, in brief, “all things.”
>...
>it makes the inheritance something very different from the one alone promised to the Patriarchs and to David’s Son, and under which promise the saints only inherit. That inheritance is the earth and not the third heaven or the Universe.

>Obs. 7. This doctrine teaches us how to regard the various theories of inheritance, such as the third heaven idea, the central universe notion, the metaphysical heaven (of Good’s, etc.), which gives no place of existence, the spiritualist’s visible unfolding of the invisible, “the Sun our Heaven” (so Mortimore, Wittie, etc.),
>...
>the inheriting of the earth was a favorite Jewish doctrine based on the Messianic prophecies and the predicted supremacy;
>...
>the Patriarchs are personally promised such an inheriting; that the Messiah is personally to receive the land as an inheritance; that the saints, ad part of a perfected Redemption, are to realize it; that a thousand predictions direct attention to it,
