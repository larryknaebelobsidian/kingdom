### Obs. 7

>This unity of agreement is also seen in John doing his preaching in the wilderness—that is, east from Jerusalem in the open country, away from the large cities. He and his hearers, both believing in *a restored Davidic Kingdom*, and he endeavoring by repentance to prepare the nation for its coming, those large gatherings of Jews and the preaching of such a Kingdom would necessarily have excited inquiry and the pressure of Roman power. Hence (especially in view of the foreseen rejection) *the utmost caution*, consistent with John’s mission, is observed.

>If the modern prevailing view of the Kingdom is the correct one, no reason can be assigned for John’s avoidance of the centres of influence, as e.g. Jerusalem.
