# Proposition 92. This Kingdom is not what some call “the Gospel Kingdom.”

>Having met with the phrase “Gospel Kingdom” in writings, and having heard it from the pulpit, this favorite expression of some may require a few remarks. By the phrase is evidently meant either this dispensation or the church or religion, or the proclamation of the gospel. It is a phrase of human coinage, nowhere found in the Bible, and is incorrect when applied to the present time. The gospel is good news, glad tidings *concerning* the Kingdom. Hence the phrase is never found in the writings of careful authors.
>p. 607 Vol. 1 Prop. 92
### "Gospel of the kingdom" not "Gospel kingdom"
>Obs. 1. It is strongly corroborative that the language of the Bible falls in so accurately with our line of argument. We read of “the Gospel *of the* Kingdom,” seeing that the Gospel itself has no power to produce the Kingdom, but is simply preliminary to it, designed to call the elect, who become “*heirs*” of the Kingdom.

### Kingdom was taken from Jews but retained the gospel
>Obs. 2. Aside from other considerations, we have shown (Prop. 59, Obs. 5), that the Kingdom was tendered to the Jews but owing to their sinfulness was to be taken from them (i.e. could not inherit or receive it), and was to be given to another chosen, gathered people. The Kingdom was taken from the Jewish nation, but the nation, as all admit, *retained the Gospel*—the privileges of this dispensation, of the church, of religion, in brief, *of all that pertains to the Gospel*. It follows, therefore, as a national sequence that if the Kingdom was taken from them, that Kingdom did not consist in “the Gospel Kingdom,” whatever meaning may be attached to it, for to this, if it denotes the present dispensation of the Gospel, the nation was made *first* accessible, the preaching of the Gospel commencing at Jerusalem.
