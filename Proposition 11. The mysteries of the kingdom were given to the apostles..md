# Proposition 11. The mysteries of the kingdom were given to the apostles.

> The entire tenor of the New Test. impresses us, that their superior qualifications as teachers arises from their acquaintance with the doctrine of the kingdom, resulting from the personal instructions received from Christ, and the subsequent special guidance of the Spirit.
> p. 141 Vol. 1 Prop. 11 

### Kingdom itself was not a mystery, just some aspects
> It may, however, be properly stated here, that there might be mysteries pertaining to the kingdom, while the kingdom itself -- what it denoted -- may be fully known.  The reader will carefully notice, that in the early period of their discipleship, the mysteries relating to the kingdom were already given to them.  It is incredible, utterly impossible, that the kingdom itself -- *what it meant* -- should, therefore, have been a mystery to them.  
> p. 141 Vol. 1 Prop. 11 Obs. 1

### Kingdom itself was made known
>. . . the assurance is abundantly ours, that *the kingdom itself*, its nature, our relation to it, all things necessary for a correct understanding of its meaning, was made known.
>p. 142 Vol. 1 Prop. 11 Obs. 3

### Mysteries of the manner of its establishment, means, preparation, and time for its manifestation
> . . . those mysteries refer not *to the nature* of the kingdom, but *to the manner* of its establishment, *the means* employed, *the preparation* for it, *the time* for its manifestation, and such related subjects.
