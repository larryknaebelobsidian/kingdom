>This follows legitimately in view of the mutual and inseparable relationship. The Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom committed to, and organized in, that nation, makes it the special depository of the trust of the Kingdom itself. It is covenanted to the nation, and only in and through the nation, by the power of David’s Son, will it be re-established, and from this establishment extend its sway over the nations of the earth. The result is, that the nation, so highly favored and honored, must, in virtue of so distinguished a relationship, sustain a certain well-defined pre-eminence among and over the other nations. It is the natural outgrowth of Covenant and promise; the result of Theocratic ordering.

>Obs. 1. This is abundantly confirmed by the direct teaching of the prophets.

>To “be established in the top of the mountains” and to be “exalted above the hills” denotes supremacy; for mountains and hills, being symbolic of kingdoms and nations, the meaning is, that the first position among the nations, an elevation above all others, is assigned to this “mountain of the house of the Lord.”

>Zech. 8:3;

>Obs. 2. The same is taught by Dan. 7:27, etc., which, while particularly describing the ascendency and rulership of “the people of the saints,” a peculiar and distinguished class (Props. 118 and 156), yet in virtue of their being also “the seed of Abraham,” grafted into the elected nation, it indicates, since this rulership is exercised at and during the restoration, that the dominion of power is to be attributed to connection with the King of the Jews, the fulfilment of the Abrahamic-Davidic Covenants, and the restoration of the nation. Hence “the greatness of the Kingdom under the whole heaven” given to them, only proves the exaltation of the Jews through the appointed Seed. The reigning of the twelve Apostles over the twelve tribes, the reign of the saints as coheirs with Christ, in the Davidic Kingdom, etc., enhances the pre-eminence and glory of the nation, through whom alone ail covenanted blessings can be obtained.

>This is easily corroborated by an abundance of predictions, such as the following: 
>1. By that class of passages in which “the horn” (symbol of power, etc.) of this nation shall be exalted, as e.g. Ps. 89:17-18; Ps. 148:14, etc. 
>2. All nations then shall regard Jerusalem the centre of worship, Micah 4:2-3; Isa. 2:3; and notice, this in the same Jerusalem formerly destroyed. Let the reader refer to Zech. 14, and see the connection and the yearly worship at Jerusalem (v. 16), and the punishment threatened against those who refuse, and no other conclusion can be consistently formed than the one given by us. And indeed, if such a Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom as predicted is established, it is eminently suitable that, aside from the spiritual worship extending everywhere, there should be a national acknowledgment of nations through their representatives of the Theocratic King and Kingdom. It is not conceivable how such “a world-dominion” having its centre at one point can exist without a fixed public acknowledgment of it, etc. 
>3. They also shall esteem Jerusalem the centre of power. Let once the idea of this covenanted Theocratic-Davidic rule be admitted, and the beauty and propriety of various prophecies appears, such as Mich. 4:2; Isa. 2:3, “the law shall go forth of Zion and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem”; Zech. 8:22, “Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the Lord” (comp. Amos 9:12; Zech. 12, etc.). 
>4. The nations shall regard it as the centre of glory. This arises from its being the metropolis of the Kingdom (Prop. 168), being “the city of the great King,” “the throne of the Lord” etc. Millennial descriptions fully portray this feeling of reverence, etc., for the city, as universal (Isa. 62:2, etc.) over the earth. 
>5. The nations shall respect and honor the Jewish nation on account of its special relationship. relationship. Thus, e.g. Isa. 61:9, “And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people; all that see them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed.” Even the individual Jews in that day shall be highly esteemed; “Thus saith the Lord of hosts (Zech. 8:23), in those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying: We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you.” 
>6. All nations shall contribute to their prosperity, wealth, riches, etc. Thus e.g. Isa. 60, 61, etc. 
>7. The Gentiles shall fear and reverence the Jewish nation. Thus e.g. Isa. 49:22, 23. 
>8. The nation shall be a praise among all nations, where it formerly was treated with derision. Thus Zeph. 3:19, 20, “I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you, for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.” 
>9. The Gentiles shall aid in glorifying this nation. Thus, e.g. Isa. 66:12. 10. Those nations that shall not acknowledge this supremacy shall perish. Thus e.g. Isa. 60:12; Zech. 14:12-19.

>Obs. 3. The simple fact that Jesus, David’s Son, “the King of the Jews", is to be the Mighty King over them, evinces this pre-eminency.

>Obs. 4. If the question is asked, why this supremacy is given to the Jewish nation in preference to all others, the answer is given Rom. 11:28, 29.

>Obs. 5. A number of observations on this interesting point might be appropriately made, which can only be indicated to the reader. 
>1. (1) This pre-eminency among the nations of the earth shows that the position assumed by us concerning the wall of partition being broken down only between believers in Christ and not between the Jewish and Gentile nations, is well taken. 
>2. (2) This work is of God, and will be witnessed by the nations as a confirmation of His power, etc., Ezek. 17:22-24, Isa. 52:1-10, etc. 
>3. (3) Jerusalem and Palestine (as the latter shall be extended according to promise) are most admirably situated (geographically) for the exercise of such supremacy. See Townsend’s Arrangement, Introd. p. 68-9. 
>4. (4) The promise to Abraham is only then literally verified, “I will make of thee a great nation.” For David and Solomon’s reign (aside from its Theocratic arrangement), plays but a small part at the side of the great empires of history. God’s Promise unerringly points to the future; and as His promises, long delayed, are sure, the greatness of the nation, as the prophets predict, will be more commensurate with the greatness of the Being who has promised. 
>5. (5) The promise made to Abraham of being “heir of the world” is then realized, in the acknowledged acknowledged pre-eminency of his seed. 
>6. (6) How wonderful will then the history of this people appear, and how astonishing that the Divine Purpose so plainly revealed should have been, by lack of faith and with the notion of exalting the meaning of Scripture itself, so persistently overlooked by the multitude. 
>7. (7) To occupy this position of supremacy, it is necessary that the division into two kingdoms, once existing, should be perpetually abolished. This is fully predicted, as e.g. Ezek. 37:21, 22, etc. 
>8. (8) The folly of being indifferent to, or totally ignoring, the predictions on this subject, just as if they were not given. 
>9. (9) That if, as many advocate, the phrase “Times of the Gentiles,” is indicative of “Gentile domination,” then the cessation of these times would of itself indicate that such dominion would come to a close.

>Obs. 6. This supremacy of the Jewish nation is a stumbling-block to many (who misapprehend its connection with the saints, etc.), and the most bitter and sarcastic remarks are levelled against it.

>Obs. 7. Milman (His. of the Jews), Wines (Com. on Laws), and others, have shown that past history records the fact that science, art, philosophy, history, jurisprudence, politics, statesmanship, finance, education, etc., are adorned with splendid Jewish names—names suggestive of vigorous intellect, large attainments, great skill, profound wisdom, and vast knowledge. If the Hebrew race in its dispersion, under its disabilities and humiliation among nations, has exhibited such talent, genius, energy, learning, enterprise, and power, what will they not become when restored to their own land under the peculiar and elevating guidance of their long expected, and at length arrived, Messiah?
