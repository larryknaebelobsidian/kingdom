>Christ, now, in virtue of His divine nature, has absolute control over all nations, over the church, etc., but He only exerts that Sovereignty (Props. 79 and so) as God in Providence, etc., not as the Son of Man (e.g. Props. 81-83), David’s Son, in His human nature.
>...
>This Rulership now belongs to David’s Son, is His both by right of covenanted birth and obedience, but is not yet realized and will not be until the establishment of the Kingdom.
>...
>He reigns not merely as the Son of God, but really and truly as the Son of Man.

>This gives us then the proper idea of Christ’s relationship to the church. As Divine, One with the Father, the church is under His care and protection; as Son of Man He sustains a Headship over the church; as the future revealed King, His interest in the church is deep and abiding.
