# Proposition 89. Christ, in view of this future Kingdom, sustains a peculiar relationship to the Church.

>Christ, now, in virtue of His divine nature, has absolute control over all nations, over the church, etc., but He only exerts that Sovereignty (Props. 79 and so) as God in Providence, etc., not as the Son of Man (e.g. Props. 81-83), David’s Son, in His human nature.
>...
>This Rulership now belongs to David’s Son, is His both by right of covenanted birth and obedience, but is not yet realized and will not be until the establishment of the Kingdom.
>...
>He reigns not merely as the Son of God, but really and truly as the Son of Man.
>p. 596 Vol. 1 Prop. 89
### Proper idea
>This gives us then the proper idea of Christ’s relationship to the church. As Divine, One with the Father, the church is under His care and protection; as Son of Man He sustains a Headship over the church; as the future revealed King, His interest in the church is deep and abiding.
>p. 596 Vol. 1 Prop. 89 Obs. 1
### Not all authority exercised now
>Obs. 2. To avoid misconception, and the charge of lowering Christ’s dignity or position, it may be in place to repeat that we most cordially receive and hold to what is said concerning Christ in Eph. 1:20-23, and other passages. But with the aid of a comparison of Scripture, we avoid the conclusion that many arrive at, as e.g. in Eph. 1:20-23, that the authority vested in Him *is now in all respects* exercised.
>p. 596 Vol. 1 Prop. 89 Obs. 2
### Headship refers to head of rulers
>Obs. 3. The Headship of Christ over the church refers not so much, as is supposed, *to Rulership over* the church as to His being *the Chief or Head* of Rulers, i.e. that the church is in come peculiar and distinctive manner *associated with* Him. What this is, will appear under the Props. (154 and 156) relating to the reign and priesthood of the saints. Christ Himself intimates this distinction when He calls faithful believers “*brethren*” and not “*servants*.” The church is represented as *Christ’s body*, simply because that body are “co-heirs,” joint inheritors with Him in the Kingdom, and therefore they are purposely never called “*the subjects of the Kingdom*”—a phrase coined by man and *contradictory* to both the honor and position of the body, which takes *a much higher rank*. It is inconsistent, to say the least, to call “inheritors” of a Kingdom, the subjects of it.
>p. 596-597 Vol. 1 Prop. 89 Obs. 3

>Jesus is called, and by right, and in the covenanted manner, is, “*the King of the Jews*,” “*King of Nations*” “*King of the World*” but is *never* called “ *the King of the Church*.”
>p. 597 Vol. 1 Prop. 89 Obs. 3

>The saints, elected *to be associated* with Christ in Rulership, are indeed subordinated to Christ. He is the Head, the Chief, and they being also kings with Him, it is rightfully His title to be styled “*King of Kings*” seeing that the latter are inferior to Him, but while subordinate, their rank, etc., elevates them as brethren and joint rulers above that *of mere subjects in the ordinary use* of the Word. They are truly subjects in one sense only, viz.: in the one given, e.g. 1 Cor, 11:3.
>p. 597 Vol. 1 Prop. 89 Obs. 3
### The "day of the Lord"
>Obs. 4. The Kingship of Jesus Christ, as David’s Son, the Theocratic Ruler, is to be manifested in a period of time, called by way of pre-eminence “*the day of the Lord*” “*the day of Jesus Christ*, etc.
>...
>The covenant promises, if actually fulfilled, require this; and hence until their realization, the church occupies the position of *waiting* (e.g. 1 Pet. 1:7, 13) for this Revelation of Jesus as King. During this expectation all things are working in behalf of the election, the contemplated gathering, the manifestation of the sons of God. The Head is preparing the members, by the bestowal of blessed privileges, sacred ordinances, rich experience, and His own ever-abiding Presence, *for the coming exaltation* of the kingdom. Communion with Christ and with each other *necessitates a churchly arrangement*, so that the requisite elect may be taken oat from among the nations to place the future Theocratic Kingdom *on an immovable basis*.
>p. 597-598 Vol. 1 Prop. 89 Obs. 4
### All things will be subject to Him
>Obs. 5. In this postponement of the Kingdom, specifically promised to the Son of Man, we do not, by any means, detract from that power which is given to Jesus, or deny that to His will all things are subject.
>p. 598 Vol. 1 Prop. 89 Obs. 5
### Making church equal kingdom leads to bad conclusions
>Obs. 6. Overlooking the design of the establishment of the Christian Church, viz.: to raise up a seed unto Abraham by gathering out of the nations a people for His name, until the throne and Kingdom, *now desolate*, shall be restored to its covenanted position, has led to some remarkable features in philosophizing.
