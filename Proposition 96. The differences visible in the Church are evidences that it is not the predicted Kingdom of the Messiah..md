# Proposition 96. The differences visible in the Church are evidences that it is not the predicted Kingdom of the Messiah.

>Having alluded to this, it may be well to particularize. The Kingdom, as promised from the details of prophecy, is to exhibit a visible outward unity. So much is this admitted by our opponents, that they are seeking for and advocating such a unity. The feeling is almost universal that prediction demands it; and hence all, not finding it yet existing, anticipate it in the future. Isaiah, chs. 60, 61, 62, 65, etc., are conclusive. But, on the other hand, such a state or condition has never been realized in the church after eighteen hundred years of trial, and therefore we conclude that the church, not exhibiting the characteristics predicted of the Kingdom and connected with its establishment, is something different from that Kingdom.
### Schism's foretold
>Obs. 1. Let the unbiassed student contemplate how schisms, etc., are foretold in the church (Acts 20:29, 30; 1 Cor. 11:19; 2 Tim. 4:3, 4; Rom. 16:17, etc.); how it was organized amidst dissensions and antagonism even among its leaders (on the subject of circumcision and observance of the law); now it affected compromises concerning the law and the ritual; how it arose without a direct verbal abrogation of Mosaic institutions, so that some followed the latter and others annoyed the Gentiles who refused the same. Christ Himself, Paul tells us, was preached a contention. These and other marks of weakness, infirmity, etc., certainly prevent us from accepting the church as the predicted Kingdom, seeing that the latter is to come in a very different manner. Its beginning (i.e. church’s) is not that assigned by the Prophets to the Kingdom of promise.
### Church history shows conflicting elements 
>Obs. 2. The progress of the church teaches the same. Surely a Kingdom established by Jesus in fulfilment of the prophecies could not possibly have the conflicting elements that the church has so lavishly shown.
### The Church has still been doing its mission
>Obs. 3. These differences, division into sects, etc. are not given under the impression that the church has not, in a measure, carried on the design intended by its organization.
>...
>These evils may to some extent have retarded and hindered the work, but still it has been going on toward completion.
>...
>But to convert this design into the Kingdom itself requires an imagination and a faith strong enough to plant—against the direct testimony of holy men of old—these evils, these conflicting elements into the Kingdom of the Son of Man.
### "Them that believe" are found in all denominations
>Obs. 4. This leads to a brief consideration of the unity of the church.
>...
>To carry out the design of the church does not necessarily require unity; unity indeed would facilitate its execution, and for various reasons it is desirable, and hence is enjoined, but really is not essential, as the history of the church conclusively proves. “Them that believe” are found in ail denominations;
