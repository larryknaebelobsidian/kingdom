>One reason why so many Messianic predictions in the Old Test., especially in the Psalms, are explained away as relating to David, Solomon, Hezekiah, etc., arises from the fact that the prophecies do not agree with the writers’ preconceived notions of the covenants and of a spiritual Kingdom. The *covenanted foundation* of the predictions is overlooked or perverted, and, of course, the superstructure is correspondingly untenable. Thus valuable Scripture is given up to unbelief. Even pious and able writers, who recognize such passages as Messianic, under the influence of the idea formed of the covenants and Kingdom, will call the very words given (as they admit) by God “very one-sided” (as e.g. Kurtz, *His. Old Cov.* vol. 3, p. 438, on Balaam’s prophecy), because they seem to them too earthly or too Jewish, forgetting that the Theocracy proclaimed pertains both to this earth and to the Jewish nation.

>The covenants *outline* the Plan of the Divine Purpose; prophecy partially *fills up and deepens* the lines thus drawn.

>History is only a witness to the fact that the history of the Church and world, as it progresses, is foreknown to God, and that He orders all things in such a manner that what He purposes to perform shall be ultimately accomplished. History, instead of being a measurer of that which so largely pertains to the future, only gives us the assurance, from the testimony of the past and present, that all God’s predictions will be verified in actual accomplishment.
