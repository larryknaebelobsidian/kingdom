# Proposition 51. The relation that the Kingdom sustains to “the covenants of promise” enables us to appreciate the prophecies pertaining to the Kingdom.

>All predictions, all promises, all preparative measures, relating to the Kingdom, are based on, and result from, these covenants. The prophecies constantly keep in view what God has covenanted and confirmed by oath, and enlarge and expand the same by amplification, explanation, etc. Therefore, to appreciate the utterances of the prophets, notice must continually be taken of the foundation upon which they are erected. To isolate them is to defeat one intent of prophecy, viz.: to instruct us in the manner by which God will ultimately fulfil His covenants and establish His Theocratic rule over the nations.
### The better destinies of the world
>Obs. 1. The one covenant singles out Abraham and his seed, and, in the words of another (Fairbairn, On Proph., p. 189), “linked indissolubly with it the better destinies of the world.” The other covenant promises the same Seed, narrowed down in the Davidic line, a specific throne and Kingdom from which “the better destinies of the world are secured. This connection is observed by the prophets, and is held up so prominently that many writers (however they explain it) have designated it as “the Abrahamic type,” or “the Davidic type.”

### To test the faith of His people
>Obs. 2. God is jealous of His covenanted Word, and after having confirmed it by oath, by the sending of His Son, etc., He presents it in a form, through additional revelation, admirably adapted to test the faith of His people. Much of it, the most precious portion of it, the distinctive features of it, still belong to the future and are dependent upon the Sec. Advent of Jesus, the Messiah. Hence the predictions of the Old and New Test., unless viewed in the light of the covenant, cannot be duly apprehended. They only form additional links to a previously forged chain, and the places in which they fit must be found and matched.
##### "Places they fit must be found and matched"

### The ignoring of the David covenant
>Obs. 3. We see the fatal mistake of those systems of Biblical and Systematic Theology, which entirely ignore the Davidic covenant.
### The foundation
>Obs. 4. The Church is “built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone” (Eph. 2:20).
### Unwarranted doctrinal constructions
>Obs. 5. The rejection of these covenants in their totality, and a resultant spiritualistic conception of the Kingdom, with a consequent mystical treatment of the prophecies, lead some of our most eminent writers to present utterly unwarranted doctrinal constructions.

### Observing the relationship of covenants to the kingdom removes alleged differences
>Obs. 6. By observing this relationship of the covenants and of prophecy to the Kingdom, those erroneous deductions are at once removed, which writers of ability have drawn from alleged differences in the teaching of the apostles.
### Effects of preconceived notions
>One reason why so many Messianic predictions in the Old Test., especially in the Psalms, are explained away as relating to David, Solomon, Hezekiah, etc., arises from the fact that the prophecies do not agree with the writers’ preconceived notions of the covenants and of a spiritual Kingdom. The *covenanted foundation* of the predictions is overlooked or perverted, and, of course, the superstructure is correspondingly untenable. Thus valuable Scripture is given up to unbelief. Even pious and able writers, who recognize such passages as Messianic, under the influence of the idea formed of the covenants and Kingdom, will call the very words given (as they admit) by God “very one-sided” (as e.g. Kurtz, *His. Old Cov.* vol. 3, p. 438, on Balaam’s prophecy), because they seem to them too earthly or too Jewish, forgetting that the Theocracy proclaimed pertains both to this earth and to the Jewish nation.
>p. 340 Vol. 1 Prop 51 Obs. 7

>The covenants *outline* the Plan of the Divine Purpose; prophecy partially *fills up and deepens* the lines thus drawn.
>p. 340 Vol. 1 Prop 51 Obs. 8
### History gives assurance
>History is only a witness to the fact that the history of the Church and world, as it progresses, is foreknown to God, and that He orders all things in such a manner that what He purposes to perform shall be ultimately accomplished. History, instead of being a measurer of that which so largely pertains to the future, only gives us the assurance, from the testimony of the past and present, that all God’s predictions will be verified in actual accomplishment.
