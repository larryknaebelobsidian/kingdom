# Proposition 160. This Kingdom is set up in the divided state of the Roman Empire.


### When Roman empire divided into ten-toed form
>Without repeating the reasoning elsewhere given, it is sufficient to say that this Kingdom, according to Daniel 7, is received by the Son of man *after* the Fourth Beast or Roman Empire is divided; *after* the rise of the ten horns and little horn, and *at* the very time that the judgments of God are to be poured out upon *the divided* Empire. The First Advent took place *when* the Empire was consolidated, the Second will occur *when* it is divided into its ten-toed form; for the smiting is upon *the feet* of the image, the reception and inheriting of the Kingdom is *after* the saints have long suffered from the arrogance, etc., of the powers arising out of this Empire, and these powers are to meet an awful infliction of tribulation.
>p. 639 Vol. 2 Prop. 160 Obs. 1
### Historical tracing
>... we have *a continuous headship of the Roman Empire* existing from the days of Augustus down to A.D. 1806, and in connection with it, descended also from the divided state of the Empire, the Papacy with its claims Empire derived.
>p. 642 Vol. 2 Prop. 160 Obs. 2
### A theory to be carefully noted
>Obs. 3. It would be well if the Church, until a better explanation is given, would *carefully note* the interpretation presented by G. S. Faber in his *Revival of the French Emperorship*.
>p. 643 Vol. 2 Prop. 160 Obs. 3

>Prudence dictates that we do not dogmatically express ourselves on such points, but that we seek light from all directions and ponder well the interpretations and hints given, and see how they will correspond with the development of history.
>p. 645 Vol. 2 Prop. 160 Obs. 3
### In divided state, for a time headless
>Obs. 4. It is in the divided state of the Roman Empire that we are to find it, for a time, *headless*, i.e. without a leading civil, imperial form of government.
>p. 647 Vol. 2 Prop. 160 Obs. 3

>Every effort to call away the attention of believers from the Roman to some other power as the head around whom the Antichristian forces shall father, *is in so far a departure from the plain truth*, no matter how plausibly represented or ingeniously portrayed.
>p. 648 Vol. 2 Prop. 160 Obs. 4

>... the position *universally occupied by the early Church*, viz., that the Antichristian power, the last head of the beast, the oppressing power which shall culminate just previous to the establishment of Messiah’s Kingdom and the ushering in of the Millennial age, *must arise in, and be fully identified with, the Roman Empire*. This belief, entertained by the churches established by the apostles, has *its firm and immovable basis* in Dan., chs. 2 and 7—in Rev. 17, etc. This faith, entertained by believing Jew and Gentile, is evidently also one that the inspired apostles fully endorsed, as seen in the Revelator John enlarging upon Daniel’s Fourth Empire and in the universality of belief which can only be appropriately accounted for on the ground that it was sustained by the private (public being avoided for prudential reasons) instruction of the apostles and elders. Hence correctly, the deduction was made that *the Roman Empire in some form or other would exist down to the end of this age, and that its close should be followed by the universal Empire of the Messiah*. So deep was this feeling that Tertullian (Apology, Sec. 32) gives as a reason why they pray for the stability of the Empire: “For we know that a mighty shock impending over the whole earth—in fact, the very end of all things, threatening dreadful woes—*is only retarded by the continued existence of the Roman Empire*.”
