>They could not consistently preach that it was established, because 
>1. (1) the covenant forbids it, the express terms of it not being verified; 
>2. (2) the rejection of the kingdom by the Jews and its consequent postponement during “the times of the Gentiles,” forbids it; 
>3. (3) the seed of Abraham to whom the Kingdom is to be given not being yet gathered out, forbids it; and 
>4. (4) the non-arrival of the Sec. Advent forbids it.

### His chosen witnesses
>After the declarations of Jesus that “the house” (Davidic) would remain desolate until His return, that He would leave, remain away for an indefinite time, that the Kingdom was connected with His coming again, etc., it is reasonable to look for a corresponding style of preaching in His chosen witnesses.
>Obs. 1
### Attack from unbelievers
>Obs. 2. The weakness and Jewish cast assigned to the early church teaching respecting the Kingdom, is the place of persistent attack from unbelievers.
### Jewish conceptions
>Obs. 3. Our argument—fortified (1) by Scripture, (2) by charges of infidelity, (3) by frank concessions of apologists—accepts of these “Jewish conceptions’ of the apostles as legitimately correct and imperatively demanded by the covenants and the Divine Purpose.
### Jewish standpoint
>Obs. 4. We take the position that if the witnesses of the truth thus occupied—as enemies and friends, assailants and defenders declare—“a Jewish standpoint,” it was necessary for them to do so in behalf of the truth itself.
### Inferential proof
>Obs. 5. Additionally it may be said: (1) If the apostles preached that the covenanted, predicted Kingdom was established, why do they not directly declare this as a fact, and thus remove error and prevent the incoming Chiliasm? Is there a single passage which directly teaches that the Christian church is the Kingdom? No such declaration or passage is to be found in all the apostolical writings. (2) Hence it is a fact which cannot be gainsaid that those who hold to a present establishment of the Kingdom exclusively rely upon inferential proof.
### Peter's first sermons
>Obs. 6. Take the first sermons of Peter, and nothing is said of the establishment of the Kingdom,

>Peter boldly asserts that Jesus was to sit on David’s throne, that He was raised up and exalted for this purpose, that He was seated at God’s right hand until the period arrives (comp. e.g. Rev. 19 and 20) for making His enemies His footstool, and that, therefore, He is both Lord and Christ.
>Obs. 6

>this Jesus, thus declared to be the Messiah, shall remain in heaven until the period of restitution spoken of by the prophets, and always linked with the Messianic Kingdom, shall arrive;
>Obs. 6

>it is utterly impossible to conceive of any other impression made upon their minds than that the Kingdom was still future, and would be established when Jesus would come again.
>Obs. 6

### Paul
Obs. 7

### James
Obs. 8
>Obs. 8. James in his Epistle, instead of a kingdom now established, calls believers “heirs of a kingdom and exhorts to a patient waiting for “the Coming of the Lord” when the promises will be realized, thus strictly verifying Christ’s statements.
### John and Jude
Obs. 9
### Epistles
>Obs. 10. The simple fact, running through the Epistles, is that the Kingdom is spoken of as still future and constantly associated with the speedy Advent of Jesus.

>The passages already adduced abundantly confirm our position, for, instead of teaching what the Alexandrian, monkish, popish, and modern schools so loudly affirm (viz.: that the covenanted Kingdom had already arrived and was in full realization and progress), they point us to the Sec. Coming of Jesus for the glorious establishment of the Kingdom.
>Obs. 10

>Take 1 Pet. 1:10-13, and we have 
>1. (1) the inheritance and salvation (Jewish phrases) “ready to be revealed in the last time”; 
>2. (2) to be realized “at the appearing of Jesus Christ “at the revelation of Jesus Christ”; 
>3. (3) and this is the same inheritance and salvation which the prophets predicted, linking it with the Messianic Kingdom on earth.
>Why should we then, contrary to the entire tenor of the Word, attempt to locate the fulfilment of this salvation, etc., at a period of time different from that specified by the apostle and his co-laborers; or, why should we disconnect that which the Spirit (“knowing the deep things of God ”) has expressly joined together?
>Obs. 10 slightly reformatted


>Let any one carefully consider the phraseology of the New Test, in reference to the coming again of Jesus, and observe how there is united with it all the Jewish hopes of kingdom, restitution, redemption, dominion, reigning, crowning, destruction of enemies, deliverance of His people, etc., and he will clearly see that the distinctive Messianic hopes, the hopes that centre in the official Christ, are postponed to the expected, precious Sec. Advent of the Messiah.
>Obs. 10

### Peter's confession - Thou art the Christ
>When Peter, therefore, made this confession he believed as fundamental to it, that “the Christ” was the kingly title of Jesus, that which indicated Him as “the anointed” One, coming as the King to restore the Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom.
>Obs. 11

>Peter continues to preach to the Jews “the Christ “ which was understood by all to denote the One anointed to be the King on David’s restored throne.
>Obs. 11

### Apostles
>The careful student of Scripture must nave been arrested by this additional peculiarity, corroborative of our argument, that in many places (as e.g. 1 Cor. 1:7, 8, etc.) the apostles rapidly pass from the present to the Advent, the intervening period being not worthy to be compared, owing to the absence of the King and Kingdom, to what transpires at the Messiah’s return; or, in other words, the distinguishing characteristics of a purely Messianic nature are attributed to the Sec. Coming, and the period intervening being merely preparatory, is passed by.
>Obs. 12

>If the predicted Messianic times, the Millennial glory, are to precede (as many declare) the Sec. Advent, could such a style of writing be adopted without dishonoring the predictions of God and the things of the Messiah? Our argument finds this distinguishing feature in harmony with all the utterances of the Spirit, and regards it as a necessary sequence of the postponement.
>Obs. 12

### Apostolic fathers
>Obs. 13. That our Proposition is true appears from the immediate result of their preaching. The early church, the Apostolic Fathers, all that were nearest to the apostles and the Elders, knew of no established Kingdom but looked for one to come at the Advent of Jesus. This is evidenced by the intensely Chiliastic position of the Primitive Church.

>When the apostles, and their co-laborers, “preached the things concerning the Kingdom of God” “preached the Kingdom of God” how does it happen that the only doctrine of the Kingdom, East and West, in the churches under their supervision (comp. Props. 73-77), is the one that we advocate?
>Obs. 13

>Can a single writer be quoted who lived in the First, and Second, and part of the Third, centuries, and who proclaimed the modern view of the Kingdom, now so generally entertained?
>Obs. 13

### Spiritualistic interpretation
>their theory of a Kingdom, compelled to have some kind of a Kingdom in actual existence during this dispensation—resort to the most arbitrary spiritualistic interpretation to locate the Sec. Advent in the past so that a resultant Kingdom may logically be connected with it
>Obs. 14
