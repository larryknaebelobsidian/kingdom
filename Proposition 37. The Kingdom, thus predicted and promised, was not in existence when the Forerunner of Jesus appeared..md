# Proposition 37. The Kingdom, thus predicted and promised, was not in existence when the Forerunner of Jesus appeared.

### Props Mentioned
20 80 81 82-84

>Many books positively assert that the covenanted Kingdom of God *continuously* existed, subject only to some changes. Eminent men (whom we shall largely quote) declare the same, and make the church (after the overthrow of the Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom) its continuation. They, however, have not adduced *a single direct passage* of Scripture in support of their theory; and *the facts*, as already stated, all clearly prove the contrary.
>p. 250 Vol. 1 Prop. 37
### Kingdom remained fallen to John the Baptist
>Obs. 1. The Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom *is the Kingdom of God*; this has been proven. Now this Kingdom was *fallen*, and it *continued* thus down to John the Baptist.
>p. 250 Vol. 1 Prop. 37 Obs. 1
### Kingdom remained fallen is not the church
>Obs. 2. The church, which was continued after the fall of the Davidic Kingdom, is nowhere directly designated the Kingdom of God. While under the care of the Divine Sovereignty, *it is not*, and, according to covenant, *it cannot be* this Kingdom.
>p. 250 Vol. 1 Prop. 37 Obs. 2
### Prophets declare the kingdom fallen
>Obs. 3. The Prophets, *in* this church, instead of pointing out *an existing* Kingdom, invariably represent it as *fallen*, and its *restoration as future*.
>p. 250 Vol. 1 Prop. 37 Obs. 3
### Kingdom not established before Jesus' arrival
>Obs. 4. This same Kingdom was promised in its *restored form* to a certain descendant of David. He was to be its *Restorer*. Now it is folly to hold, that the Kingdom existed just *before* His appearance. His Advent and the Kingdom are inseparably linked together, so that the offspring of David, the long promised Son, must *first appear, and then* the Kingdom. This is the order laid down by all the Prophets. The Kingdom is promised to the Son of Man, and He must first come as man.
>p. 250 Vol. 1 Prop. 37 Obs. 4
### Great looseness and latitude of opinion
>Obs. 5. The greatest looseness and latitude of opinion exist among able writers.
>p. 250 Vol. 1 Prop. 37 Obs. 5
### Earthly, not separate from the covenants
>Obs. 7. Let the reader consider, what is too much overlooked, that this Kingdom is one of promise and here on the earth, and hence does not refer to the divine nature of the Father or of Christ considered in itself, separate and apart from *the expressed covenanted relationship* (comp. Props. 80 and 81).
>p. 251 Vol. 1 Prop. 37 Obs. 7
### Kingdom not preached before John the Baptist came
>Obs. 9. This Kingdom was not preached to the people immediately before John the Baptist came. Luke (16:16) says that Jesus declared’: “The law and the prophets were until John; *since that time* the Kingdom of God is preached.” in whatever way this is explained (see Judge Jones’s Notes, p. no, etc., and Com. on Matt. 11:12, 13), it certainly implies a period of time preceding when the Kingdom was *not directly offered* for acceptance. The legitimate inference follows, that it was *not* in existence. It was, indeed, predicted, promised, believed in, and expected, but it was *not* authoritatively offered for present acceptance and realization, as was done by John and those following him.
>p. 251 Vol. 1 Prop. 37 Obs. 9
### John's language demonstrates that the kingdom did not exist during his days.
>Obs. 10. That the Kingdom did not thus exist, is very apparent from the language of John himself (Matt. 3:2): “Repent ye, for the Kingdom of heaven *is at hand*,” implying, forcibly, that for some time it had not been near, seeing that it *now* drew nigh.
>p. 252 Vol. 1 Prop. 37 Obs. 10
### Endorsed by many able theologians
>Obs. 12. Many able theologians fully indorse our Proposition as a self-evident fact.
>p. 252 Vol. 1 Prop. 37 Obs. 12
