# Proposition 37. The Kingdom, thus predicted and promised, was not in existence when the Forerunner of Jesus appeared.

>Many books positively assert that the covenanted Kingdom of God continuously existed, subject only to some changes. Eminent men (whom we shall largely quote) declare the same, and make the church (after the overthrow or the Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom) its continuation. They, however, have not adduced a single direct passage of Scripture in.support of their theory; and the facts, as already stated, all clearly prove the contrary.

>Obs. 1. The Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom is the Kingdom of God; this has been proven. Now this Kingdom was fallen, and it continued thus down to John the Baptist.

>Obs. 2. The church, which was continued after the fall of the Davidic Kingdom, is nowhere directly designated the Kingdom of God. While under the care of the Divine Sovereignty, it is not, and, according to covenant, it cannot be this Kingdom.

>Obs. 3. The Prophets, in this church, instead of pointing out an existing Kingdom, invariably represent it as fallen, and its restoration as future.

>Obs. 4. This same Kingdom was promised in its restored form to a certain descendant of David. He was to be its Restorer. Now it is folly to hold, that the Kingdom existed just before His appearance. His Advent and the Kingdom are inseparably linked together, so that the offspring of David, the long promised Son, must first appear, and then the Kingdom. This is the order laid down by all the Prophets. The Kingdom is promised to the Son of Man, and He must first come as man.

>Obs. 5. The greatest looseness and latitude of opinion exist among able writers.

>Obs. 7. Let the reader consider, what is too much overlooked, that this Kingdom is one of promise and here on the earth, and hence does not refer to the divine nature of the Father or of Christ considered in itself, separate and apart from the expressed covenanted relationship (comp. Props. so and 81).

>Obs. 9. This Kingdom was not preached to the people immediately before John the Baptist came. Luke (16:16) says that Jesus declared’: “The law and the prophets were until John; since that time the Kingdom of God is preached.” in whatever way this is explained (see Judge Jones’s Notes, p. no, etc., and Com. on Matt. 11:12, 13), it certainly implies a period of time preceding when the Kingdom was not directly offered for acceptance. The legitimate inference follows, that it was not in existence. It was, indeed, predicted, promised, believed in, and expected, but it was not authoritatively offered for present acceptance and realization, as was done by John and those following him.

>Obs. 10. That the Kingdom did not thus exist, is very apparent from the language of John himself (Matt. 3:2): “Repent ye, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand,” implying, forcibly, that for some time it had not been near, seeing that it now drew nigh.

>Obs. 12. Many able theologians fully indorse our Proposition as a self-evident fact.
