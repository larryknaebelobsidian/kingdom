# Proposition 156. The doctrine of the Kingdom enforces the future priesthood of the saints.

>The promise is that the saints shall be both “kings and *priests*” (Rev. 1:6, and 5:10, and 20:6) in the coming Kingdom. Prop. 154 shows the civil relationship of the saints, this one relates to the religious, for, like Christ, the Theocratic King, they are *both civil and religious rulers*. The nature of a Theocracy demands, in view of the inseparable union of State and Church, such a leadership in order to secure the requisite purity and perfection.
>p. 607 Vol. 2 Prop. 156

### Union of priest and rulership
>Obs. 1. A Theocracy, to preserve a manifested unity and enforce its authority supremely, requires the union of priesthood and rulership in the same persons.
>p. 607 Vol. 2 Prop. 156 Obs. 1

>Obs. 2. Jesus in His Coming Kingdom is both King and Priest.
>. . .
>Now, the saints being co-heirs with Him, participants of His honor and glory, partake of His Kingship and Priesthood. In this they “shall be like Him,” thus fulfilling the promises pertaining to the greatness of their joy, honor, and glory. Hence they are distinctively promised, not only the exaltation of kingship, but also that of priesthood.
>p. 607 Vol. 2 Prop. 156 Obs. 2

>Obs. 4.
