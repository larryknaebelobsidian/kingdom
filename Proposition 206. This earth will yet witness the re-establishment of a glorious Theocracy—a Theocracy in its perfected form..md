# Proposition 206. This earth will yet witness the re-establishment of a glorious Theocracy—a Theocracy in its perfected form.
### God Himself, in the Person of Jesus, the Son of David, rules as an earthly ruler
>Attention is again called to the fact that this form, of government, predicted to be established and to extend itself over the earth, is a Theocracy, i.e. God Himself, in the Person of Jesus, the Son of David, rules in it as an earthly Ruler. This form of government is already seen in the Theocracy, initiatory, once established (Props. 25, 20) and which incorporated the Davidic line (Props. 27-33). God was the Supreme Ruler —the earthly King. This fundamental idea must necessarily be retained, if justice is done to the direct representations of Scripture, seeing that the entire tenor and analogy of the Record incontestably proves that the same Theocracy overthrown, owing to the sinfulness of the nation, shall be again restored under the Messiah with increased splendor and power (comp. Props. 31, 32, 33, 31, 35, and 30).
>Obs. 1

### Consistency and Reasonableness of this theocracy
>We press upon the notice of the reader the consistency and reasonableness of such a future Theocracy. The relation that man and this earth sustains to the most High God requires that the honor and majesty of God should demand the establishment of a Theocracy here on the earth, by which the race is brought under a government honorable alike to God and man. Our line of argument strongly develops this feature, and the student will appreciate its force, if attention is called to a few points. 
>1. (1) At the creation God had determined upon this form of government (Props. 1 and 2); 
>2. (2) man by disobedience forfeited a dominion which God through him was to exercise over the earth (Props. 8 and 82); 
>3. (3) God has resolved to restore that dominion in the Person of Jesus, the Second Adam (Prop. 82); 
>4. (4) God—to indicate in what form of government this dominion should be incorporated when restored, to test man’s present capacity capacity for it, and to make certain indispensable provisions for the future—erected a Theocracy (Props 25, 20, etc.); 
>5. (5) man, owing to sinfulness, was unfitted for a Theocratic ordering, and, therefore, it was withdrawn (Props. 32, 33, etc.); 
>6. (6) God promised at some future time to restore it (Props. 33-36); 
>7. (7) this Theocracy is God’s own preference for a form of government, and if not restored makes His proposed government a failure (Prop. 201); 
>8. (8) God has sent His Son to make provision for Salvation, i.e. to lift man and the race out of the state of rebellion and to restore all the blessings forfeited by the fall (comp. e.g. Props. 190, 182, 144, etc.); 
>9. (9) this Salvation in its ultimate realization is invariably linked with this still future Coming Kingdom (so e.g. Props. 120, 121, etc.) 5 
>10. (10) God, to insure the future permanent establishment of the Theocracy, is preparing a body of rulers for the same to be associated with “the Christ” (Props. 01, 86, 05, and 153); 
>11. (11) that until this Theocracy is set up the race is not brought into subjection to God (comp. e.g. Props. 176, 152, 204, etc.); 
>12. (12) however glorious in design this dispensation may be, there is still an incompleteness in Redemption and which will continue until “the Messiah” comes to restore the Theocracy (Props. 87, 88, 120, etc.); 
>13. (13) when this Theocracy is re-established, then under the rulership of Christ and His saints the race itself is brought into subjection to God—a revolted province is brought back to its pristine allegiance and blessedness ( Props. 124, 200, 151, etc.); 
>14. (14) the Theocracy is the form of government most admirably adapted to secure this result (Props. 128, no, 117, 119, etc.); 
>15. (15) a theocracy being in its nature a visible government, such a sovereignty and redemption completed must be visibly shown in the sight of the world, so that—as rightly belongs to God and is done in heaven itself —it be publicly recognized (Props. 121, 122, 131, 154, etc.); 
>16. (16) the personal relationship of God to Adam in Paradise, to the Theocracy once established in the past, to man in and through Jesus at the First Advent, insures a future special and continued personal relationship in a restored throne and Kingdom (by way of pre-eminence called His own) as exhibiting His Supremacy in the most tangible and satisfactory manner, and that the recovery of a rebellious people and race, as well as the manifestation of God’s will being done on earth as in heaven, includes such a personal relationship in the Person of Him who is “the Son of Man” (Props. 81, 86, and 199, 204, etc.).

### Nothing but a real theocracy can satisfy the Scriptures
>Nothing but a real Theocracy can possibly satisfy the representations given in the Scriptures. Let the reader consider the numerous reasons presented in its behalf, some of which are the following: 
>1. (1) The actual establishment of a Theocracy which God claims as His special Kingdom, and which He withdraws under promises of future restoration (Props. 25, 33, etc.). 
>2. (2) The covenant, confirmed by oath, positively demands its future restoration under David’s Son (Prop 49). The Kingdom that is covenanted to that future David’s Son is not some other form of government, but the identical Theocracy identified with David’s throne and Kingdom (Props. 31-33). 
>3. (3) The postponement  of the Kingdom (Props. 66, 67, 87) makes it indisputably certain that this Theocracy will be restored at the return of Jesus. His own words are amply sufficient to sustain our faith in such a blessed expectation. 
>4. (4) The prophecies, in their plain sense, imperatively demand the Theocracy to be restored (Props. 21, 32, 33, etc.), seeing that the same Theocracy overthrown is the one that they declare shall be gloriously re-established. 
>5. (5) The faith and hope of the pious Jews implies such a regained Theocracy (Props. 20, 40, and 85), because we cannot believe that God would thus incite and foster a false faith and hope by an admitted sense of His Word to be sadly disappointed. No! He will be faithful to the sense given under His own auspices, and these ancient believers shall yet exult in the full realization of anticipated deliverance and glory in the restored Theocracy. 
>6. (6) John the Baptist’s faith and hope imply the same (Props. 38-41), for it is impossible, without degrading a person “filled with the Holy Ghost” and specially commissioned to preach the Kingdom, to believe believe that John should utterly misapprehend the nature of the Kingdom he was to proclaim. 
>7. (7) The doctrinal views of the disciples, apostles, and primitive Church (Props. 43, 44, 70, 71-78), in reference to the Kingdom, were such that they cannot be consistently explained (without lowering their commission, inspiration, and faith), unless we receive their expectations of a future re-established Theocracy to be the truth. 
>8. (8) The confining by Jesus of the preaching of the Kingdom—its tender—to the Jewish nation (Props. 54, 55, etc.), indicates that the Theocracy, which pertained to them, was the Kingdom offered. Hence, as the very Kingdom tendered to them is the one postponed to the Sec. Advent (Props. 66-68), the same Kingdom must be the one ultimately restored. 
>9. (9) The Kingdom not being established under John’s ministry (Prop. 41), not under Christ’s (Prop. 56), and not in this dispensation (Props. 70, 71, and 90 to no) corresponds with the nature of the Theocracy, seeing that no such form of government has yet been witnessed. 
>10. (10) The design of this dispensation (Prop. 86), the preparatory nature of the Church (Props. 88-105), the gathering out of a people to inherit the Kingdom (Props. 61-65)—these are all points in agreement with our position respecting the future Theocracy, and thus aid in establishing it. 
>11. (11) A correct understanding of the Divine Sovereignty as something ever existing, and the covenanted Kingdom which that Sovereignty bestows (comp. Props. 79 and so), enforces the precise idea of a real Theocracy, pertaining to a special rule confined to this earth. 
>12. (12) A consideration of this Kingdom as belonging, byway of covenant, specifically to “the Son of Man,” and what this implies (Prop. 81), brings forward the Theocratic ordering alone as intended. 
>13. (13) The restoration of the dominion forfeited by the first Adam through the Second Adam (Prop. 82) involves a rule such as we know can only be realized after the Sec. Advent of Jesus, and which the Scriptures unite with this re-established Theocracy. 
>14. (14) This Theocratic Kingdom is given to Jesus by the Father (Prop. 83), but as a result of His obedience, sufferings, and death (Prop. 84), and, in view of the time of bestowal and the reason for the same, corroborates our faith in an ultimate real Theocracy. 
>15. (15) The promises to the saints of inheriting this Kingdom (Prop. 90, etc.) at the period of the Sec. Advent, coincide with so many other declarations and predictions relating to this Theocracy and the positions they shall occupy therein, that they corroborate and strengthen our belief. 
>16. (16) The Theocracy being Christ’s inheritance (Props. 122, 49), and as He has not yet restored the same Theocracy (down-fallen) which all the prophets unite in testifying He will perform, we confidently hold that the Theocracy will be, must be, again manifested. 
>17. (17) A Pre-Millennial resurrection (Props. 125-129) so admirably fits into the future Theocratic ordering as promised, that the very fact of its being taught and allied with the Kingdom at the Sec. Advent, in order to promote the efficiency, grandeur, and power of the then existing Theocracy, confirms our faith in the same. 
>18. (18) The inheriting of the earth by the meek (Prop. 142), implies it, seeing that under such a Theocratic ordering and the ruling involved in it, the saints have dominion over all the earth, etc. 
>19. (19) The predicted place of manifested royalty (Prop. 168) can only be reconciled, without undue violence to the language, with this doctrine of a future Theocracy. 
>20. (20) The restoration of the Jews (Props. in-114) unmistakably proves the correctness of our position, because that restoration is indispensable to the re-establishment of the same Theocracy overthrown (the nation being in covenanted relationship to it), and its extension over the world. 
>21. (21) The supremacy of the Jewish nation (Prop. 114), so clearly taught, can only be explained in view of this future restored Theocracy, seeing that nation is brought into special nearness to it on account of its national covenanted affinity (Props. 24, 29, 30, 54, 55-64) to it. It strongly confirms our doctrine, being just what we might reasonably anticipate. 
>22. (22) The simple fact that the restoration of forfeited blessings (Prop. 119) is linked by the prophets with this regained Theocracy, materially aids in sustaining our view. 
>23. (23) These forfeited blessings thus united with the Kingdom can only be introduced by the power of Christ (Prop. 120), and hence, to be fulfilled here on earth as portrayed, necessitates a Pre-Millennial Advent of Jesus. Such an Advent is abundantly taught (Prop. 121), and thus fully sustains our doctrine. 
>24. (24) The Barren Woman (Prop. 118), as well as many other predictions taken isolated, can only be consistently interpreted in the light of such a future Theocracy in which the saints form a chosen corporate body intimately associated with Christ, and the Jewish nation one that is specially favored by God. Such predictions, therefore, afford additional proof in favor of our position. 
>25. (25) The prophecies relating to the destruction of Antichrist and the removal of all wickedness (Props. 115, 123, 161, 162, 163), by the personal intervention of Jesus, are only reconcilable with our doctrine of the Kingdom, and form a requisite preliminary to a correct understanding of its introduction and power. 
>26. (26) The same can be said of the predictions relating to the end of Gentile domination (Prop. 164), which in intent exactly agrees with the predicted Theocratic ordering extending over the world, but cannot be made to fit into the prevailing views of the Kingdom. The very fact that it ends, shows that it is superseded by another form of domination, even the one that we advocate. 
>27. (27) The predictions pertaining to a visible reign of Christ (Props. 122,131, 117) are alone perfectly consistent with a restored Theocracy; they do not fit into any other system of faith and hence are not retained in their plain meaning but are either spiritualized, or made typical of something else. 
>28. (28) The Judgeship of Jesus (Prop. 132) in all its fulness of detail and richness of power exhibited, can only be predicated of such a Theocracy. Limiting it to simple judicial action is to strip it of its scriptural and Theocratic meaning. 
>29. (29) The day of judgment (Prop. 133) in its grand results and its wide sweep of jurisdiction, serves to indorse the Theocratic idea. No other belief can incorporate what is stated in reference to it. 
>30. (30) “The world to come” (Prop. 137) as used by the Jews to designate the restored Theocracy under the Messiah, and its retention and location at the Sec. Advent, shows that our faith is well-grounded. 
>31. (31) The day of the Lord Jesus Christ” (Prop. 138) designating a period of time after the Sec. Advent, in itself is highly expressive of our view. This time so specially relating to Christ, certainly pertains to an era when His Theocratic reign, as covenanted, is inaugurated. 
>32. (32) This is strengthened by what is said of “the morning” of “the day of Christ” (Prop. 139) and the events connected therewith—the whole being associated by the prophets with the commencement of such an age still future. 
>33. (33) “The rest” or “Sabbatism” (Prop. 143) is significant of such a Theocracy, and by the analogy of Scripture is connected therewith. 
>34. (34) “The end of the age” and the things preceding and following (Prop. 140) are expressive of the beginning and perpetuation of the Theocratic rule. 
>35. (35) The perpetuity of the earth (Prop. 141) and the perpetuity of the race (Prop. 152), after the Sec. Advent, so essential to this Theocratic idea, are clearly taught and sustain, in simple consistency, the glorious Theocratic rule over the Jewish and Gentile nations. They are doctrines which necessarily must be revealed in order to make the Theocratic rule practicable. 
>36. (36) The New Heavens and New Earth (Props. 148, 151) united by the prophets with this restored Theocracy, impressively teach what kind of a government Christ exerts over the nations. 
>37. (37) “The times of Restitution” (Prop. 144), “the Regeneration” (Prop. 145), the deliverance of creation (Prop. 146) are all inseparably connected with the “appearing and Kingdom,” i.e. with a Kingdom established here on earth after the sending again of Jesus, that they strongly corroborate the doctrine here advocated. 
>38. (38) The Transfiguration (Prop. 153), the Temptation of Christ (Prop. 106), the belief in the speedy Advent by the primitive Church (Prop. 74), the Father’s house (Prop. 170), the marriage of the Christ to the New Jerusalem (Prop. 169), the perpetuity ascribed to this Kingdom (Prop. 159), these bring forth additional reasons confirming our trust in the plain grammatical sense of the covenants, prophecies, and promises descriptive of a real Theocratic government. They indicate the kind of Kingdom intended, its rulers, subjects, and permanence. 
>39. (39) The visible reign of the saints here on the earth after the Advent over nations, subordinate to the Christ, plainly reveals (Props. 154 and 156) not only the Theocratic rule, but how it is then inaugurated and carried on in a perfected form under perfected rulers, thus insuring its stability and blessedness. 
>40. (40) The location of the Millennial period (Prop. 158) after the Sec. Advent, can only be made to accommodate itself to our view. To our Theocratic system it is essential; to any other it would be an excrescence. The prophets link their Millennial descriptions with a restored Theocracy. 
>41. (41) The nonconversion of the world before the Sec. Advent (Prop. 175 and 176) is confirmatory of our position, seeing that, in view of the direct portraiture of this dispensation and of the Church down to the Advent itself, no place is found for the fulfilment of the Millennial predictions; and they must, of necessity, be located where all Scripture Scripture places them, viz., after the Advent, and under the instituted Theocratic ordering. 
>42. (42) Even the very condition of unbelief assumed by the Church and the world (Props. 177, 178, 180) respecting the means to inaugurate the Kingdom and the Kingdom itself, confirms our faith, seeing that such a state of unbelief in God’s predictions, and promises, and mode of procedure, is to be characteristic of the last times. Unbelief in the covenanted and predicted restored Theocratic Kingdom is pre-eminently characteristic of the Church and world today. 
>43. (43) The translation of the saints, as a preparatory measure (Props. 130 and 118), is only in agreement with a proposed Theocratic ordering, seeing that such a translation is intended to prepare them for a rulership in it. 
>44. (44) The rudimentary re-organization of the Theocracy at Mt. Sinai (Prop. 166) in the future, the Revelation of the Divine Will (Prop. 167) adapted to this renewed and perfected ordering, the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of fire (Prop. 171) then experienced, encourage the retention of the ancient faith, because these indicate how we can become suitably prepared to participate in the wonderful out-goings of Theocratic rule. 
>45. (45) The fact that belief in this restored Theocracy brings forth “the One Hope” (Prop. 182) which sustained a multitude of believers; that it exhibits in this Theocracy a manifested unity (Prop. 184) which never can be realized without it; that it is supported by the analogy of Scripture, the analogy of faith, and the analogy of tradition (Prop. 185) which no other system can claim; that it gives coherency and unity of design to the Gospels, Acts, Epistles and Apocalypse (Props. 187-191); that it forms a key to open Scripture (Prop. 192) making much plain that otherwise would he dark; that it does not drive us to deprive the Jews of their retained faith and hope in the plainly expressed predictions of God’s Word (Prop. 193), but leads us both by the grammatical sense to accept of a future Theocratic ordering under the Messiah—these things have considerable weight in influencing us to follow the path of pious Jews, martyrs, etc., who longed and prayed for “the Christ” to come and set up His inherited Kingdom. 
>46. (46) The world’s history (Prop. 194) is a mystery and incomplete without this restored Theocracy; for God to undertake a Theocratic form of government and not to complete it, and for Him to promise its restoration and make the most suitable provision for it, and then not to manifest it, would leave a void fatal to the happiness of the individual of the race, and of the world. 
>47. (47) When we regard the precious provision made by Jesus (comp. Prop. 195) for this very Theocratic ordering; when we contemplate the Person of Jesus, most wonderfully adapted to secure an exact, pure, real Theocratic rule (Prop. 199), and when we consider the title of Jesus, “the Messiah,” “the Christ” (Prop. 205) as alone applicable to a restored Theocracy, we certainly would be lacking faith in God and in His promises if we refused to receive, cordially and hopefully, the belief that, at the time determined by the Father, the Messiah shall come again, and fulfil the covenants and predictions relating to the restoration of a fallen Theocracy in a state of glory such as inspired men describe.

>Why does God so carefully trace the rise and progress of the Jewish nation to the establishment of the Theocracy, then enter into fulness of detail respecting the Theocracy, its History and downfall; then avoiding any connected history of the nation so long as separated from the form of government He Himself instituted, He only presents a sufficiency to give coherency to predictions and preparations relating to the future? Why does God specially single out this Jewish nation as alone worthy of detailed mention, and pass by those mighty nations (with brief mention) that existed contemporaneously? Why does He devote so many pages to a special form of government, and pass by those forms which largely fill the pages of profane history and which played such a prominent part in the world’s drama? Such questions are only satisfactorily answered by a reference to the Theocratic ordering.
