>It could not be, because *no restored Theocracy*, such as the prophets predicted, the covenant demanded, and he preached, followed. This is seen by *the failure* of John’s mission, which was designed to prepare, if possible, consistently with moral freedom, the nation for the Kingdom. 
>p. 262 Vol. 1 Prop. 41 

### Obs. 1

>John was not conscious of a Kingdom being established, as is noticeable in the message that he sent, shortly before his death, from prison to Jesus. 
>p. 262 Vol. 1 Prop. 41 Obs. 1

### Obs. 2

>That no Kingdom was established is evident from *the continued style* of preaching the Kingdom *after* John’s imprisonment and death, for Jesus, the disciples, and the seventy announced it, not as *actually present*, but as still future. 
>p. 263 Vol. 1 Prop. 41 Obs. 2

### Obs. 3

>The imprisonment and death of John itself is indicative of our position, for it shows that, instead of a Kingdom, suffering is allotted; the Forerunner is rejected, and the Kingdom cannot be obtained without blood shed in its behalf. A *martyred* Forerunner is an appropriate foreground to a *crucified* King, and reminds us how dearly this very Kingdom is purchased.

### Obs. 4

>This satisfactorily answers the question, *why* John continued his ministry *after* the public appearance of Christ. The solution is found in John baptizing not only in view of a Messiah to come, but of a Kingdom to come. The Kingdom, and meetness for it, was the burden of his preaching, and the foundation motive for urging repentance. Now if the Kingdom had appeared, as some writers contend, as soon as Jesus was baptized by John or even earlier, *then* John’s mission would have ended; but as the Kingdom was not manifested, John could continue his own ministry without change. Jesus only commenced (Matt. 4:17) His preaching when John was imprisoned. 
>p. 263 Vol. 1 Prop. 41 Obs. 4

### Obs. 5

>The non-establishment of the Kingdom is shown in the fact that the disciples of John, instructed by himself, and their adherents after John’s death, even after the death of Jesus, formed a sect who still waited for the coming of the Messiah (Gieseler, *Ch. His.* 1:69, Lange’s Com., p. 69, etc.). This can only be accounted for on the ground that, not seeing the Kingdom established as preached by John, and unacquainted with or failing to appreciate its postponement to the Sec. Advent of the crucified Jesus, they still looked for the manifestation of the Kingdom, and, of course, then for the Messiah to restore it. 
>p. 264 Vol. 1 Prop. 41 Obs. 5

### Obs. 6

>The brevity of John’s ministry is readily accounted for; brief as it was, it was *sufficiently long* to indicate *the unfitness* of the nation for the Kingdom (comp. Lange, Com., Matt. 3:1-12, p. 68, 2d col.). Different writers inform us that it was very successful and give us glowing accounts how the multitude “pressed into” the Kingdom; but we have the *decided testimony* of the Lord Himself that, whatever degree of success attended John’s efforts in the beginning, his mission to the nation was acceptable only *to the few*; the representative men of the nation were not gained, they did not repent (Matt. 11:18).
