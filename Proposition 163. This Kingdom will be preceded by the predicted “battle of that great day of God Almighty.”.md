>Antichrist arrives at, and takes, Jerusalem, he immediately sends (or probably sent before the fall of the city) a portion of his vast army under Rome of the kings toward and into Idumea, for the purpose of crushing any opposition that may develop itself from Mt. Sinai. It is at this crisis that Jesus and His brethren proceed toward Jerusalem, and on the road meet and fearfully overwhelm a large body of the Antichristian host, and then advancing to the Mt. of Olives, confronts His daring adversary, and crushes him there as the prophets declare. It would only be a repetition on a grander scale of the fighting in the wilderness, and in the land itself under the first Theocratic march from Mt. Sinai.
>Obs. 9

>we agree with him that a prevailing mistake has been long current and adopted, unthinkingly, by able writers, viz., that this gathering of Antichrist’s forces is to Armageddon, from whence springs the popular phrase, “the Battle of Armageddon”—a phrase not found in the Bible, but still adopted as the title of some books, under the plea that it is biblical.
>Obs, 10

>His open revelation with the saints, which occurs only when Antichrist has reached Jerusalem,
>Obs, 10

>a gathering takes place at the first stage of the Advent; that these are taken to Mt. Sinai; that there will be an assembling of the saints at that mountain previous to going forth to the destruction of Antichrist; that this gathering here is also one allied with the Advent, it is reasonable to conclude, that the gathering here is to the same “mountain of assembly,” where precious gifts are indeed bestowed.
>Obs. 10
