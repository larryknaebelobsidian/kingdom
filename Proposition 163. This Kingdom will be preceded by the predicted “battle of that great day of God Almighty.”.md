## Props Mentioned
[[Proposition 115. The Kingdom is not established without a period of violence or war.|115]] [[Proposition 123. The Pre-Millennial Advent and the accompanying Kingdom are united with, the destruction of Antichrist.|123]] [[Proposition 160. This Kingdom is set up in the divided state of the Roman Empire.|160]] 

>This Proposition is given not to prove that a great conflict will ensue between Antichrist with his confederated forces and the Lord Jesus Christ and His army (for this has been done in previous Propositions, as e.g. Props. 115, 123, etc., and is too plainly predicted, as e.g. Rev. 19:15-21; Rev. 17:14, and 16:14, etc., to require additional notice, but to direct attention to some particulars connected with it.
>p. 751 Prop. 163 Vol. 2

>We are reminded of Rev. Dr. J. G. Schmucker's (*Erp. of Apoc.*, p. 36) remark, when referring to the last struggle with Antichrist: "O God! these things are so near at hand, and we continue so careless and unconcerned for ourselves and our children; they are so certain and important, and we are so unprepared to meet them, as our heavenly calling requires". It is a remarkable fact (which students will do well to ponder), that even the most spiritualizing of commentators fully concede a terrible period to precede the Millennium, as e.g. Scott, *Com*., Rev. 19:17-21, Barnes, *Com. loci*, etc. So writers, who spiritualize the prophecies, and make a large number of "mystical comings," are compelled to advocate a still future terrible period before the Church. Thus e.g. Smith (*Key to Rev*., p. 169, etc.) contends that the spread of missions should not prevent the Church from also anticipating a fearful persecution, likewise predicted. He says: "If the Church has scenes of danger before her, and God has given us warning of it, it will not aid the cause of Christ to cry peace, and assure her that her warfare is already accomplished. If soldiers have a battle to fight, it but ill prepares them for it to assure them they have already gained the victory, and the enemy are vanquished. Should such assurance be given them, lest they be discouraged, would this prepare them for the battle? The Millennium is certain, and will be glorious.  But it will be just preceded by the battle of that great day of God -- last and most violent attach of Satan.  And *no victory* must be shouted previous to this, unless by anticipation. The armor must be put on and kept bright, and the warnings of the Word of God sounded." So also, under ch. 14 and 19, he speaks of "fiery trials yet to pass before the Millennial sun will smile upon the earth. The people of God who may then live will have a signal opportunity to glorify our Lord Jesus Christ, and to brighten their eternal crown." We are glad that the warning is given, even if surrounded by much that weakens its force or clearness, for it is immensely better that that deceptive cry which *utterly ignores* those future predictions as if they did not exist, and declares (as e.g. Dr. Harkey in *the Church's Best State*, p. 168--with which compare Dr. Sprague, *On Revivals*): "We believe that it will be one great and universal Revival, that Messiah will finally subdue the world to Himself, and amid the bliss and hellelujahs of such a state, He will reign in Millennial glory." (Comp. Prop. 175.) Even such a political prophet as Chateaubriand (Ticknor's *Memoirs*), although ridiculed, has a more truthful view of the future, when he says what shall be produced (1818): "The cloud is too dark for human vision; too dark, it may almost be said, to be penetrated by prophecy. There perhaps is the misery of our situation; perhaps we live not only in the decrepitude of Europe, but in the decrepitude of the world."

>Antichrist arrives at, and takes, Jerusalem, he immediately sends (or probably sent before the fall of the city) a portion of his vast army under Rome of the kings toward and into Idumea, for the purpose of crushing any opposition that may develop itself from Mt. Sinai. It is at this crisis that Jesus and His brethren proceed toward Jerusalem, and on the road meet and fearfully overwhelm a large body of the Antichristian host, and then advancing to the Mt. of Olives, confronts His daring adversary, and crushes him there as the prophets declare. It would only be a repetition on a grander scale of the fighting in the wilderness, and in the land itself under the first Theocratic march from Mt. Sinai.
>Obs. 9

>we agree with him that a prevailing mistake has been long current and adopted, unthinkingly, by able writers, viz., that this gathering of Antichrist’s forces is to Armageddon, from whence springs the popular phrase, “the Battle of Armageddon”—a phrase not found in the Bible, but still adopted as the title of some books, under the plea that it is biblical.

>a gathering takes place at the first stage of the Advent; that these are taken to Mt. Sinai; that there will be an assembling of the saints at that mountain previous to going forth to the destruction of Antichrist; that this gathering here is also one allied with the Advent, it is reasonable to conclude, that the gathering here is to the same “mountain of assembly,” where precious gifts are indeed bestowed.

#### [Rev. 19:15-20](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=rev+19%3A15-20)
And from His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the wrath of the rage of God, the Almighty. 16 And He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.” 17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, “Come, assemble for the great supper of God, 18 so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of strong men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great.” 19 Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army. 20 And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who did the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.


#### [Isaiah 63:1-6](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=isa+63%3A1-6)
Who is this who comes from Edom,
With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah,
This One who is majestic in His clothing,
Marching in the greatness of His power?
“It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.”
2 Why is Your clothing red,
And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press?
3 “I have trodden the wine trough alone,
And from the peoples there was no man with Me.
I also trod them in My anger
And trampled them in My wrath;
And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments,
And I stained all My clothes.
4 For the day of vengeance was in My heart,
And My year of redemption has come.
5 I looked, and there was no one to help,
And I was astonished, and there was no one to uphold;
So My own arm brought salvation to Me,
And My wrath upheld Me.
6 I trod down the peoples in My anger
And made them drunk in My wrath,
And I brought down their lifeblood to the earth.”

#### [Rev. 14:18-20](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=rev+14%3A18-20)
Then another angel, the one who has authority over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.” 19 So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered _the clusters from_ the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God. 20 And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses’ bridles, for a distance of 1,600 stadia.

#### [Isaiah 49:24-26](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=isa+49%3A24-26)
“Can the prey be taken from the mighty man,
Or the captives of _the_ righteous be granted escape?”
25 Surely, thus says Yahweh,
“Even the captives of the mighty man will be taken away,
And the prey of the tyrant will be granted escape;
For I will contend with the one who contends with you,
And I will save your sons.
26 I will feed those who mistreat you with their own flesh,
And they will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine;
And all flesh will know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior
And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
