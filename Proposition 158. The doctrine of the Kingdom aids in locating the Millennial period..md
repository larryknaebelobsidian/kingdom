# Proposition 158. The doctrine of the Kingdom aids in locating the Millennial period.

### Props Mentioned
57-68 88-102 111 112 113 114 121 122 164 174 177 178
### Not in the past
>Obs. 1. Hence the doctrine of the Kingdom refutes the theory of those who locate the Mill, era *in the past*.
>p. 622 Vol. 2 Prop. 158 Obs. 1
### Not this dispensation
>Obs. 2. This doctrine also disproves the theory of those (as e.g. some R. Cath. Theologians and others, who simply regard the Millennial prophecies as a portraiture *of this dispensation past, present, and future*.
>p. 624 Vol. 2 Prop. 158 Obs. 1
### Opposing theories
p. 625-626 Vol. 2 Prop. 158 Obs. 3
>Obs. 3. The line of argument already adduced adequately meets all other opposing theories respecting the Millennium.

Examples:
1. Ignore the millennial era, pass it by in silence
2. Transplant it into the third heaven
3. Make an organization into a form of the millennium
4. Locating millenium in future but spiritualizing its predictions

### No millenium is not "the Church doctrine"
p. 626-627 Vol. 2 Prop. 158 Obs. 4

### The consummation is after the 1000 years of Rev. 20
>Obs. 5. Against all theories which locate the Mill, age (the thousand years) in the past or present, or after the last resurrection, it is sufficient to point out, what every able commentator of the Apoc. concedes, viz., that the distinctive thousand years of Rev. 20 follow *after* the seven seals, seven trumpets and seven vials; *after* a certain harvest and vintage; *after* a particular Advent and conflict; *after* a complete overthrow of Antichristian enemies; *after* a binding of Satan; and then *after* the supremacy and ruling of saints it is followed by “a little season” witnessing a remarkable but futile outburst of enmity; and *then, and only then, after* the thousand years *are ended* comes the last resurrection and the entrance into the eternal ages.
>p. 627-628 Vol. 2 Prop. 158 Obs. 5
### Restoration of the Jews is a pre-requisite
>Obs. 6. The Millennial period is inseparably connected *with the restoration of the Jews* (which the restored Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom absolutely demands—see Props. Ill, 112, 113, 114). The prophecies, the covenant, the restitution, all require this as a *preliminary*. Millennial blessedness without the cessation of Jewish tribulation and the elevation of that nation to its predicted supremacy, is something *unknown* to the Scriptures. Hence this simple distinctive point is itself sufficient to crush opposing theories which contradict it.
>p. 628-629 Vol. 2 Prop. 158 Obs. 6
