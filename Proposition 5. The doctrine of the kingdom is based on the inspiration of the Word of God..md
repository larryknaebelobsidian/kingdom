2 Timothy 3:16, 17
All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, 17 so that the man of God may be equipped, having been thoroughly equipped for every good work.

2 Peter 1:20, 21
Know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes by one’s own interpretation. 21 For no prophecy was ever made by the will of man, but men being moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.

>. . .1 Cor. 2:13; Mark 12:26,36, and 13:11; Acts 1:16, and 2:4
  p. 74 Vol. 1 Prop. 5 Obs. 3 note 1

### Obs. 2

> The things pertaining to the kingdom contain facts, preparatory stages, historical connections, relations to the future, ideas above human capacity, that could not possibly have been known if God had not revealed them.  The kingdom is simple that which the Almighty designs to have accomplished as *the grand result* of the Divine economy.
> p. 70 Vol. 1 Prop. 5 Obs. 2

### Obs. 3
Some of the statements Peters makes in Observation 3 regarding [[inspiration]] surprised me and and brushed contrary to my understanding of [[inspiration]].

> the extreme so strenuously contended for by some, that ***even the words themselves were inspired, is evidently burdening [[inspiration]] with a load that is unnecessary.***
> p. 72 Vol. 1 Prop. 5 Obs. 3 - emphasis mine

> ***we must not necessarily assume that every word or sentence is inspired***
> p. 72 Vol. 1 Prop. 5 Obs. 3 - emphasis mine

> The only safe conclusion to which a believer in the Word can come, amid the variety of conflicting opinions and on a subject which certainly has its difficulties, is to adhere to the utterances of the Word itself concerning it, and ***to frame a definition which neither exceeds nor lessens the extent given to it by Scripture.*** There is not reason why the definition given (e.g. by Horne, vol. 1, *Introd.* p. 92) long ago should be discarded -- viz., that it is "the imparting such a degree of Divine assistance, influence, or guidance, as should enable the authors of the Scriptures to communicate religious knowledge to others, without error or mistake, whether the subjects of such communications were things then immediately revealed to those who declared them, or things with which they were before acquainted." A definition which embraces the ideas taught, freedom from error, and essential unity in teaching, sufficiently covers the ground. Taking the Scriptures as they teach, we must, if believers in the same, receive them as given, even under the peculiar style, learning, disposition, etc., of the writers, and sufficiently precise in expression to give a correct meaning to that God intended.
> p. 73 Vol. 1 Prop. 5 Obs. 3 - emphasis mine

> Taking such a view, ***it is not necessary to insist that every specific word or phrase or sentence is directly inspired***; that God gave no freedom to the writer in choice of language, and no latitude in the manner of conveying ideas.
> p. 73 Vol. 1 Prop. 5 Obs. 3 - emphasis mine

### Obs. 4

> we insist upon it that the apostles were fully and accurately acquainted with the doctrine of the kingdom, *i.e.*, as to its nature, and hence were qualified to teach it. Aside from their being specially called to preach the kingdom, this [[inspiration]] influence bestowed upon them (*e.g.*, Luke 12:12, John 16:13, 14, 15, Luke 24:49, 1 Cor. 2:12,13, Eph. 3:4, 1 Pet. 1:12, etc.) would *most certainly* preserve them from error on this great, leading subject of the Bible.
> p. 77 Vol. 1 Prop. 5 Obs. 4

> The express declarations of the apostles themselves that they were guided by the Spirit, the positive promises given to them to guide them into the truth, forbid our receiving such estimates of the apostles' knowledge.
> p. 77 Vol. 1 Prop. 5 Obs. 4

> The gospel of the kingdom was preached by them before and after the death of Jesus ; it was a familiar subject, leading and fundamental, and therefore one that *they must have known sufficiently* to describe it without mistake or decided error.
