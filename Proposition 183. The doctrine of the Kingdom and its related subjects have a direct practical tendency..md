### Props Mentioned
130 135 155 156 158 174 175
### Affects interpretation of the Bible

>p. 321 Vol. 3 Prop. 183 Obs. 2
### Eschatology
>Obs. 3. Our doctrine deals largely in *Eschatology*, ...
>p. 321 Vol. 3 Prop. 183 Obs. 3
### Completes christian character
>Obs. 4. Indeed, some things connected with our doctrine are regarded so *essential* to the completeness of Christian character, that the true believer is represented as in possession of them.
>. . .
>A symmetrical character demands the heart and attitude of a waiting, watching servant. Dr. Klink (Lange’s *Com. loci*) observes: “This constant expectation of our Lord’s Second Coming (Rom. 8:19, etc.), when He shall be revealed in His glory unto all (Col. 3:4), is one of the characteristic features of primitive Christianity.” (Comp. Phil. 3:20; 1 Thess. 1:10; Tit. 2:13; 2 Tim. 4:8.) No matter how we may interpret the connection, it is a fact, plainly evidenced by the passage, that the believers specially trained under the apostleship *had this characteristic*, and are *commended* for its possession.
