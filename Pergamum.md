#sevenchurches

### The Judge
The One who has the sharp two-edged sword

### The Considerations
I know
- where you dwell
	- where Satan's throne it
- you hold fast My name
	- did not deny My faith
		- in the days of Antipas (My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you)

### The Judgement
- You have some who hold the teaching of Balaam
	- who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit acts of immorality
- You have some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans

### Corrective Action
- Repent

### Penalty
- I am coming to you quickly
- I will make war against them with the sword of My mouth


He who has a ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches
### Reward
To him who overcomes
- I will give some of the hidden manna
- I will give him a white stone
	- a new name written on it which no one knows but he who receives it
