>Obs. 2

### One-sided argument of interference
>Obs. 4. The objection that a supernatural interference would argue imperfection in creation and Providence, is purely one-sided.

>Obs. 5. Before entering upon the consideration of the miraculous, it is necessary, first of all, to come to a decision respecting the supernatural; whether indeed a Higher Power exists in addition to nature which can introduce the miraculous.
