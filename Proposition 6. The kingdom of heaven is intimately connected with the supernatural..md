# Proposition 6. The kingdom of heaven is intimately connected with the supernatural.

### Props Mentioned
None

>The whole Bible, whose leading theme is the kingdom, is grounded on the supernatural. Remove this, and you destroy, if not the book itself, the chief characteristic, the distinguishing excellency of the Scriptures.
>p. 80 Vol. 1 Prop. 6

>By "the Supernatural" we include both the existence of God as the great First Cause of all things, and that He is able to, and does, work above, in and through what are known as "the laws of Nature." It is more than "the Superhuman," since the latter is found in Nature itself (i.e., in exerting powers, introducing forces, and bringing forth results beyond man's ability and comprehension), while the former exists independent of Nature (i.e., the seen and experienced in Creation) and yet sustains to the Natural a most intimate relationship as its framer and upholder.
>p. 80 Vol. 1 Prop. 6 note
### The Bible begins with the supernatural and natural in harmony
>Obs. 1. The Word begins with the supernatural (the presence of God) and the natural in harmony.
>p. 80 Vol. 1 Prop. 6 Obs. 1

> Without the supernatural the kingdom *cannot* be produced, for it requires, as predicted, *a supernatural king,* who has been provided in a supernatural manner, and rulers who have experienced a supernatural transforming power.
> p. 80 Vol. 1 Prop. 6 Obs. 1
### Promise of removal of the curse impossible without supernatural
>It is admitted, that outside of Revelation, we have no decided promises that the groanings of creation can ever be removed, and that, if this is ever performed (e.g. death abolished), it must be done by a higher power than is now manifested in and through nature.
>p. 81 Vol. 1 Prop. 6 Obs. 2
### A kingdom without the supernatural would show it is an idea of human origin
>Obs. 3. If we had a Revelation and a kingdom proposed by it, without a supernatural element claimed and exerted, then the objection would be urged, without the possibility of contradiction, that it was merely of human origin.
>p. 82 Vol. 1 Prop. 6 Obs. 3
### One-sided argument of interference
>Obs. 4. The objection that a supernatural interference would argue imperfection in creation and Providence, is purely one-sided.
>p. 83 Vol. 1 Prop. 6 Obs. 4

>... how easily objections are formed when the heart desires them ...
>p. 83 Vol. 1 Prop. 6 Obs. 4

>Man cannot describe a greater, more perfect, more absolute sovereign *than the Bible* in its simplicity does, when it makes Him so all-powerful that He is able, and does, at any time *He chooses*, intervene in *His own* workmanship.
>p. 84 Vol. 1 Prop. 6 Obs. 4
### View of a Higher Power
>Obs. 5. Before entering upon the consideration of the miraculous, it is necessary, first of all, to come to a decision respecting the supernatural; whether indeed a Higher Power exists in addition to nature which can introduce the miraculous.
>p. 85 Vol. 1 Prop. 6 Obs. 5
