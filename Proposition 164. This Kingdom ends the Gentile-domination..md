# Proposition 164. This Kingdom ends the Gentile-domination.

>King Jesus is *the covenanted King*, not only over His special inheritance, the Jewish nation, but also over all the earth; and, as already abundantly proven from Scripture, the time is surely coming when all governments will be overthrown, making place for *the universal Kingdom* of the Lord Jesus Christ.
>p. 773 Vol. 2 Prop. 164
### Under Gentile power until ...
>Obs. 1. The inheritance of David’s Son (from whence His royalty is to be manifested) is left under Gentile power 
>1. *until* “the times of the Gentiles” are completed (Prop. 66); 
>2. *until* the number of the elect is filled up (Props. 65, 86, etc.); 
>3. *until* the time of the resurrection and rewarding of the saints (Rev. 11:15-18; Props. 126-130); 
>4. *until* the time of the Second Advent (Props. 74,121, etc.); 
>5. *until* “the end of the age” (Prop. 140); 
>6. *until* a people is raised up to sustain the dignity, etc., of the Kingdom (Props. 124, 154); 
>7. *until* the power of Christ is exhibited (Props. 120, 121); 
>8. *until* the destruction of Antichrist (Props. 123, 161); 
>9. *until* the revelation of the Judgeship of Christ (Prop. 132) and “the judgment-day” (Props. 133 and 134); 
>10. *until* “the day of the Lord Jesus” (Props. 138 and 139) is to be ushered in; 
>11. *until* the last great battle is fought (Prop. 163), etc.
>p. 773 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 1 -- reformatted
### Times of trial and testing
>For the times of triumph are not *in* “the times of the Gentiles;” the latter are “times” of trial and testing, “times” in which the institutions of the world hold their sway, in which the saints are “pilgrims and strangers,” and which are also plainly delineated (comp. Props. 174, 175).
>p. 774 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 3

>We must patiently await the ending of these “times,” and *then*, and *then only*, will “*the sure mercies of David*” be realized in the Theocratic ordering and the rich blessings resulting therefrom.
>p. 774 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 3
### "Night" and "darkness"
>Eminent and good men, overlooking the utterances of the Spirit of truth, and in their eagerness to honor the Church, call that “*day*” which the Spirit designates “*night*” and that “*light*,” which the Word recognizes as “*darkness*.”
>p. 775 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 4

>This dispensation includes “the times of the Gentiles,” for they are only closed by their fearful overthrow at the Second Advent (Rev. 19, etc.), and while in this dispensation the Church, with all her blessings and privileges, is still in “the night,” surrounded by darkness (herself led by “*the light shining in the dark place*,” and by “*the day-star*,” 2 Pet. 1:19, or by “*the light*” Jno. 1:9, etc.), looking for an absent bridegroom, fighting, struggling, and pressed with the curse, it is certainly unwise, both against Scripture and existing fact, to appropriate to her blessings which only belong to her *after* these “times” are ended.
>p. 775 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 4
### Leads to glory of the Gentile nations
>Obs. 6. But the nations, in their selfishness and opposition to the truth, refused to recognize what at the same time is so plainly revealed, viz., that while Gentile domination ceases, it simply ceases because the new order or dominion introduced is *immensely its superior* in securing the happiness and glory of the Gentile nations.
>p. 775 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 6
### Spoken of guardedly to avoid hostility
>Obs. 7. Reference has been made several times to *the guarded manner* in which the primitive Christians, including even Jesus and the apostles, spoke of the downfall of Gentile dominion. This was done in order to avoid the hostility and persecution of the Roman Emperors. Yet the view was more or less distinctly proclaimed by the believers, and was one reason why the millenarian doctrine fell into disrepute, especially after a union of State and Church, with those in power.
>p. 776 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 7
### Theocratic King born when gentile domination was at its height
>Obs. 8. The reader may regard it as significant that the Theocratic King was born at the very time that the Gentile dominion was in its most extended and consolidated form.
>p. 777 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 8

>... when Jesus, “the Christ,” appeared and tendered the Kingdom to the elect nation (Props. 54, 55, etc.) which, if accepted (by a national repentance), would nave broken the Roman Power with irresistible force.
>p. 777 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 8

>When He comes again, the time selected is also one in which this Gentile dominion shall be manifested in a vast confederation (Prop. 160, etc.), and when, humanely speaking, the Church shall so experience its persecuting power that no hope for its continuance appears possible.
>p. 777 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 8
### No christian nation has ever existed among the Gentiles
>Obs: 9. It is a significant fact, fully attested by history, past and present, that no *Christian* nation has ever existed among the Gentiles.
>p. 778 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 9
### No approval from God on any other government
>Obs. 10. The reader will not fail (which we repeat, in order to impress) to observe, that while civil government is ordained by God as something that necessarily proceeds from the nature of man and of society (next Prop.), yet as *the forms* of it are of man’s ordinance, and subject more or less to depravity, God has nowhere, *excepting only* the Theocratic form, given His approval to any special one.
>p. 778 Vol. 2 Prop. 164 Obs. 10
### Administered through righteous and glorified agents
>Obs. 11. Turning back to Props. 131, 154, 159, and others (e. g. Prop. 201,202, 206,etc.) of similar import, it will be seen that a Theocracy embracing a pure Infallibility, administered through righteous and glorified agents, is to possess the rule over the earth.
