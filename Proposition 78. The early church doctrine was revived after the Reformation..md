### Four various views of Chiliasts
Obs. 1

### Some reformers were Chiliasts (or partial) but none were Whitbyans
Obs. 2

### Reformers not directly Chiliasts - Luther, Melanchthon, Zwingli, Calvin, and Knox
Obs. 3
They held the Augustinian or Popish views

>viz.: that the church, in some sense, was the Kingdom of God (preparatory to a higher stage), and that the Millennial period (one thousand years) included *this* dispensation or gospel period (some of the Millennial descriptions being applicable only to a future period either in heaven or the renewed earthy, and hence was nearing its close.
>p. 527 Vol. 1 Prop. 78 Obs. 3


>But each of these recorded their belief, in
> 
>the duty of every believer to be *constantly looking for the Advent*, 
>in *a speedy* Advent, 
>in there being no future Millennial glory *before the coming of Jesus*, 
>in the church remaining *a mixed state* to the end, 
>in *the design* of the present dispensation, 
>in *the principle of interpretation* adopted, 
>in unbelief again extending and widening *before* the Advent, 
>in the *renewal* of this earth, etc.—
>
>doctrines *in unison with Chiliasm*. The simple truth in reference to them is this: that they were not Chiliasts, although teaching several points *that materially aid* in sustaining Chiliasm (as e.g. in those enumerated), and in some, as Luther and Melanchthon, holding that at the end of the 6th Chiliad —the close of six thousand years—Christ would appear and introduce a glorious Sabbatism (Prop. 143). They were thus *really Anti-Millenarian* in the sense of expressing faith in a proper Millennium yet to come, or in that of believing in a Millennium already past, and this *can be abundantly proven* from their writings, in their declarations of the future anticipated condition of the world, in their hopes of an Advent drawing nigh, and in their emphatic denial of a conversion of the world prior to the expected Advent.

>Therefore it is that neither Millenarians (*excepting* in the features stated) nor Whitbyans (i.e. believers in a future Millennium brought about without the Advent through present agencies) can wholly claim them.
>p. 528 Vol. 1 Prop. 78 Obs. 3
