### Four various views of Chiliasts
Obs. 1

### Some reformers were Chiliasts (or partial) but none were Whitbyans
Obs. 2

### Reformers not directly Chiliasts - Luther, Melanchthon, Zwingli, Calvin, and Knox
Obs. 3
They held the Augustinian or Popish views

>viz.: that the church, in some sense, was the Kingdom of God (preparatory to a higher stage), and that the Millennial period (one thousand years) included *this* dispensation or gospel period (some of the Millennial descriptions being applicable only to a future period either in heaven or the renewed earthy, and hence was nearing its close.
>p. 527 Vol. 1 Prop. 78 Obs. 3


>But each of these recorded their belief, in
> 
>the duty of every believer to be *constantly looking for the Advent*, 
>in *a speedy* Advent, 
>in there being no future Millennial glory *before the coming of Jesus*, 
>in the church remaining *a mixed state* to the end, 
>in *the design* of the present dispensation, 
>in *the principle of interpretation* adopted, 
>in unbelief again extending and widening *before* the Advent, 
>in the *renewal* of this earth, etc.—
>
>doctrines *in unison with Chiliasm*. The simple truth in reference to them is this: that they were not Chiliasts, although teaching several points *that materially aid* in sustaining Chiliasm (as e.g. in those enumerated), and in some, as Luther and Melanchthon, holding that at the end of the 6th Chiliad —the close of six thousand years—Christ would appear and introduce a glorious Sabbatism (Prop. 143). They were thus *really Anti-Millenarian* in the sense of expressing faith in a proper Millennium yet to come, or in that of believing in a Millennium already past, and this *can be abundantly proven* from their writings, in their declarations of the future anticipated condition of the world, in their hopes of an Advent drawing nigh, and in their emphatic denial of a conversion of the world prior to the expected Advent.

>Therefore it is that neither Millenarians (*excepting* in the features stated) nor Whitbyans (i.e. believers in a future Millennium brought about without the Advent through present agencies) can wholly claim them.

>Prominently among these are the following: the profound Biblical scholar Joseph Mede (born 1586, died 1638), in his still celebrated Clavis Apocalyptica (translated into English) and Exposition on Peter; Th. Brightman (1644), Expositions of Daniel and Apoc.; J. A. Bengel (a learned divine, born 1687, died 1752), Exposition of the Apocalypse and Addresses on the same; also the writings of Th. Goodwin (1679); Ch. Daubuz (1730); Piscator (1646); M. F. Roos (1770); Alstedius (1643 and earlier); Cressener (1689); Farmer (1660); Fleming (1708); Hartley (1764); J. J. Hess (1774); Homes (1654); Jurieu (1686); Maton (1642); Peterson (1692); Sherwin (1665); and others (such as Conrade, Gallus, Brahe, Kett, Broughton, Marten, Sir I. Newton, Whiston, etc.), materially aided in directing attention to the Millenarian doctrine and to influence persons to Biblical study on the subject.
>p. 539 Vol. 1 Prop. 78 Obs. 7

>When these were followed by men eminent for learning and marked ability (some have been mentioned, others will follow); when the leading poets and commentaries gave an additional impulse to Millenarian doctrine by their forcible portrayals and exegetical comments; when persons of the highest and lowest position, in all ranks and professions, of undoubted piety and usefulness, thus united in expressing Chiliastic views, the doctrine of the early church received correspondingly a revival and renewed strength in the hearts and hopes of believers.

### Rise of Millenarianism in the U.S.
Obs. 9

### U. S. Scholars holding to Chiliasm
>The progress of Chiliastic doctrine in this country, while immensely in the minority, has been highly respectable, as admitted even by our opponents. It embraces many of the ablest, most devoted and scholarly men that the church has produced.

>However respectable the number of adherents to our doctrine in whole or in part, yet they form but a *small* minority in comparison with *the immense* body that rejects the belief once so prevailing in the church.
>p. 549 Vol. 1 Prop. 78 Obs. 22

>The retention of the Augustinian theory or Constantinian view by some; the general adoption of a spiritualizing interpretation to sustain a Church-Kingdom view; the reception of the Whitbyan hypothesis; the issuing of works in which our doctrine is caricatured, misrepresented, and ridiculed; the linking of our doctrine with the vagaries and fanaticism of certain parties to make it odious; the incorporation of some parts of our system by smaller organizations that exerted but little influence; the parading of mistakes made by some rash writers both as to time and details; the influence of leading societies in their publications, their endowments, commentaries for popular use, periodicals, etc.; in brief, the unfriendliness of worldliness, sect, indifference, unbelief, prejudice, etc., has been exerted to overpower this ancient faith. Numerous Numerous instances will be cited as we proceed. The fact that great and good men—men eminent for piety and ability in the church—have aided in decrying the doctrine has had a powerful influence upon the minds of many (comp. Props. 177-180). Doctrinal belief is not, however, decided by numbers (Matt. 8:13, 14, and 22:14; 1 Cor. 1:26, 27, etc.).

### Newspapers, periodicals exhibiting Chiliastic doctrine
Obs. 28

### Survival of Chiliasm of the past centuries
Obs. 29
>The survival of Chiliasm, amidst the opposition, ridicule, persecution, etc., of the past centuries, is worthy of notice. Dr. West (*His. of the Doc*.) has some forcible remarks on this point, showing “that only because it is *an imperishable truth of God* has it been able to survive the ordeal which it has passed.” Considering the reproach attending it—the debasements and admixtures to which it has been subject; how offensive it was to Gentile rulers, to Gnostic and Alexandrian teachers, to Papal claims; the persecutions to which it was exposed; the obloquy heaped on it as heresy to crush it; the misrepresentations, abuse, hostility, etc., heaped upon it, as found in thousands of works; and considering the pious and eminent men who clung to it, taught it, and urged it upon others, it must be—as Chiliasts affirm—a truth found in the Divine Record, planted there *by God Himself* to inspire faith and hope.

### Conclusion
>In conclusion, a brief resume of our historical argument, to show its connection, is in place. The evidence in support of each step is *ample and conclusive*. Indeed, no other doctrine has *a more clear and decisive proof* in its behalf drawn from historical ground than this one. 
>1. We have shown that the Jews, before and at the First Advent, held to it, professing to derive it from covenant and prophecy. (Compare e.g. Props. 20, 21, 40, 44, 72, 74.) 
>2. Then we prove that John the Baptist and the disciples both entertained and preached the doctrine. (Compare Props. 38, 39, 43.) 
>3. Next, that the doctrine was still held after the death of Jesus. (Compare Props. 69, 70.) 
>4. Extended evidence is given that the apostles, after the ascension and after the day of Pentecost, still adhered to it. (Compare Props. 71, 72 with Props. 66-68.) 
>5. It is proven that our doctrine was generally, if not universally, received by the early churches, East and West, North and South. (Compare Props. 72, 73, 74, 75.) 
>6. This doctrine was perpetuated by the followers and successors of the first teachers. (Compare Prop. 75.) 
>7. That it was only changed and opposed under the Gnostic and Alexandrian influences. (Comp. Prop. 76.) 
>8. That the Papacy materially aided in crushing the doctrine, because obnoxious to her teaching, claims, etc. (Comp. Prop. 77.) 
>9. That, thus almost exterminated under Papal influence, there was a revival after the Reformation, since which time it has again been taught by able and devout sons of the church, as shown in this Prop.
