>There is only one kingdom, Prop. 35, etc. Saints who become the seed of Abraham, are to receive, inherit this kingdom of promise, 1 Thess. 2:12; 2 Thess. 1:5; 2 Pet. 1:11; Matt. 25:34, etc. The Kingdom preached by the Baptist, Jesus, and the disciples continues to be proclaimed, Acts 8:12; 14:22; 20:25; 28:31, etc., and believers become “heirs” of it, Jam. 2:5. The wicked shall not inherit it, 1 Cor. 6:9. The apostles represent themselves and co-laborers as working for it still future, Col. 4:11; 2 Thess. 1:5; 2 Tim. 4:18; Heb. 12:28, etc.
### The kingdom is future
>Obs. 1. This Proposition is only intended to specify one of the results arising from preceding Propositions; and it is decidedly corroborative of our argument that the Scriptures employ language to indicate the futurity of the kingdom.

>If the church is the Kingdom, and believers are now in it, why designate them “heirs” etc., of a Kingdom?

>If believers already by entering the church, enter into the promised Kingdom of God, and if this Kingdom is merged into a future one, it would be somewhat inconsistent to urge them to strive for that which they already possess; or, at least, the language ought to be so changed that they are urged to retain their hold upon a present Kingdom lest they forfeit the future prolonged one.
### Wrong conclusions
>Obs. 2. Making the church the promised Kingdom, and believers in the enjoyment of it, has logically led some of our opponents (not all, for many recoil from it in view both of experience and the sad history of the church), to proclaim, that the promises relating to the reign of the saints are now also fulfilling.
### Only for believers
>Obs. 3. Only believers are promised this Kingdom. Faith and its fruits are essential to its inheritance. This is pointedly declared in Scripture, as e.g. Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5, etc.
### The church leads to the kingdom
>Obs. 4. In Matt. 16:18, 19 Jesus seems to distinguish between the church and the Kingdom by placing the Kingdom of heaven in opposition to it, enforcing the idea that the church leads to, or is appointed as a means to attain unto, the Kingdom.
### Confirming passage - Matt. 8:11-12
>Obs. 5. The passage Matt. 8:11, 12, when “many shall came from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdom of heaven but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out” etc., not only confirms (1) the Proposition; (2) the election of the Jewish nation; (3) the offer of the Kingdom to the covenanted people, bat it also establishes (4) the fact, that the church is not the Kingdom here mentioned, seeing that this Kingdom is related in the covenanted manner with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Hence commentators generally apply this Kingdom either to the third heaven or to the one still future.
### Possession in anticipation and expectation
>Obs. 6. Flesh and blood cannot inherit (i.e. to become a ruler in it) this Kingdom, 1 Cor. 15:50. Just as it is with the Head, the Mighty One, that the covenant and promises demanded an immortal Ruler, so it is with His members, the body. As King He is to be manifested in His glorified form—a David’s Son possessing all that is requisite to fulfil the Word; so also the saints, as co-heirs, kings and priests must be in their glorified condition before they receive the Kingdom. Hence, while in the church, in flesh and blood, they only await the promises—hope and pray for their realization. The church, then, instead of possessing a Kingdom, as actually existing according to promise, only possesses it in anticipation, in looking for and expecting its arrival.
### No prophecy of an inter-advent kingdom
>Obs. 7. Prophecy does not predict a Kingdom to exist between the First and Second Advents of Christ as a prelude to the Kingdom of the Eternal Ages. To make out such a prediction, Prophecy must be wrested from its connection, or else it must be spiritualized to make it sufficiently accommodating.
