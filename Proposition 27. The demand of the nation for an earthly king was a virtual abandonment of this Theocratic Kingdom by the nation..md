>This is explicitly stated; for when (1 Sam. 8:4-9) the elders of Israel desired a king, God told Samuel, “they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them” and entered against it a “solemn protest.” On the day of presentation (1 Sam. 10:17-19), Samuel protested: Ye have this day rejected your God” in this matter of asking for a king. To show the nation “the great wickedness” it was guilty of “in the sight of the Lord in asking you a king,” to Samuel’s word was added (1 Sam. 12:16-19), by way of attestation, a severe thunder-storm in harvest time. The sinfulness consisted (ch. 12:12) in saying that “a Icing shall reign over us, when the Lord your God was your King.”
