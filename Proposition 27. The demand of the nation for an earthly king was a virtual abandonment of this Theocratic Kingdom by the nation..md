# Proposition 27. The demand of the nation for an earthly king was a virtual abandonment of this Theocratic Kingdom by the nation.

>This is explicitly stated; for when (1 Sam. 8:4-9) the elders of Israel desired a king, God told Samuel, “*they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them*” and entered against it a “*solemn protest*.” On the day of presentation (1 Sam. 10:17-19), Samuel protested: *Ye have this day rejected your God*” in this matter of asking for a king. To show the nation “the great wickedness” it was guilty of “in the sight of the Lord in asking you a king,” to Samuel’s word was added (1 Sam. 12:16-19), by way of attestation, a severe thunder-storm in harvest time. The sinfulness consisted (ch. 12:12) in saying that “*a king shall reign over us, when the Lord your God was your King*.”
