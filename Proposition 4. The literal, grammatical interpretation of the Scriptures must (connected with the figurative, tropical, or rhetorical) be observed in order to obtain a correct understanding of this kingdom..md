> I hold for a most infallible rule in expositions of the Sacred Scriptures, that where a literal construction will stand, the furthest from the letter is commonly the worst. There is nothing more dangerous than this licentious and deluding art, which changes the meaning of words, as alchymy doth, or would do, the substance of metals, making of anything what it pleases, and bringing in the end all truth to nothing.

> I have grounded my preaching upon the literal word ; he that pleases may follow me, he that will not may stay.

> In confirmation of such a course, it may be said : if God has really intended to make known His will to man, it follows that to secure knowledge on our part, He must convey His truth to us *in accordance* with the well-known rules of language.  He must *adapt Himself to our mode* of communicating thought and ideas. If His words were given to be understood, it follows that He must have employed language to convey the sense intended, agreeably to the laws grammatically expressed, controlling all language; and that, instead of seeking a sense which the words themselves do not contain, we are primarily to obtain the sense that the words obviously embrace, making due allowance for the existence of figures of speech when indicated by the context, scope, or construction of the passage.

> By "literal," we mean the grammatical interpretation of Scripture.  Some writers, to avoid lengthy or circumlocutory phraseology, have employed the phrase "literal interpretation," by which they denote, not that every word or sentence is to be taken in its rigid literalism, but that the language of the Bible is to be interpreted by the customary rules of grammar and rhetoric, which are used in determining the sense of the "Iliad," "Paradise Lost," and works of human composition.  We are to accept of a strictly literal rendering, unless we have the distinctive marks of figures of speech, when the tropical sense is also received, without *afterward, in addition*, engrafting upon it another and separate sense which is not allowed by the rules of grammar, but which (i.e., last added sense) is applied by many to the Bible, as if the language of that book was not fairly circumscribed by, but formed an exception to, *the universal laws* of language.
> p. 48 Vol. 1 Prop. 4 Obs. 1

>When employing the word "literal," we are to be comprehended as also fully acknowledging the figurative sense, the beautiful ornaments of language; we cordially accept all that is *natural* to language itself, its naked strength and its charming adornments, but object to *additionally* forcing on it a *foreign* element, and enclosing it in a garb that hides its just proportions.
>p. 48 Vol. 1 Prop. 4 Obs. 1

> The Jews, as is well known, while to a large degree holding to a literal interpretation (as e.g. in reference to a literal coming and kingdom of the Messiah, etc.), at the time of the First Advent had fallen more and more into a figurative and allegorizing interpretation, which culminated in the speculative Cabala.
> p. 48 Vol. 1 Prop. 4 Obs. 1 note 1

> I here once more repeat, what I have so often insisted on, that the Christian should direct his efforts toward understanding he so-called *literal sense of Scripture, which alone is the substance* of faith and of Christian theology, which alone will sustain him in the hour of trouble and temptation, and which will triumph over sin, death, and the gates of hell, to the praise and glory of God.  The allegorical sense is usually uncertain, and by no means safe to build our faith upon; for it depends for the most part on human opinion only, on which if a man lean he will find it no better than the Egyptian reed.  There Origen, Jerome, and similar of the Fathers *are to be avoided, with the whole of that Alexandrian school which abounds in* this species of interpretation.

> that golden rule of all sound interpretation which Luther first introduced, namely, that all the sacred books contain but one single meaning
> p.  49 Vol. 1 Prop. 4 Obs. 1 note 2

> Unbelievers and semi-believers generally advocate that the construction of the Bible is like that of other books, but refuse (Bauer, etc.) to credit the fact that it is diverse from all other books in the authority and truths that it contains.  Our entire argument following shows that we hold it to be above and beyond all other books in the unity of supernatural and Divine things embraced. 
> p.  49 Vol. 1 Prop. 4 Obs. 1 note 3

> Let the reader consider that the grammatical interpretation was for ages *the only one* used; and can a reason be given why it should suddenly be abandoned for another?
> p.  49 Vol. 1 Prop. 4 Obs. 2

> God appeals to the literalness of His Word, as affording proof that each part shall find in due time its mate.  His veracity and power are staked on a literal fulfilment.
> p.  50 Vol. 1 Prop. 4 Obs. 2

> It is the most reasonable to anticipate, that a principle of interpretation once universally held and for ages applied, would not undergo a reversal without a plain direction from God authorizing it to be made.
