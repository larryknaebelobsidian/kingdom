> I hold for a most infallible rule in expositions of the Sacred Scriptures, that where a literal construction will stand, the furthest from the letter is commonly the worst. There is nothing more dangerous than this licentious and deluding art, which changes the meaning of words, as alchymy doth, or would do, the substance of metals, making of anything what it pleases, and bringing in the end all truth to nothing.

> In confirmation of such a course, it may be said : if God has really intended to make known His will to man, it follows that to secure knowledge on our part, He must convey His truth to us *in accordance* with the well-known rules of language.  He must *adapt Himself to our mode* of communicating thought and ideas. If His words were given to be understood, it follows that He must have employed language to convey the sense intended, agreeably to the laws grammatically expressed, controlling all language; and that, instead of seeking a sense which the words themselves do not contain, we are primarily to obtain the sense that the words obviously embrace, making due allowance for the existence of figures of speech when indicated by the context, scope, or construction of the passage.

> By "literal," we mean the grammatical interpretation of Scripture.  Some writers, to avoid lengthy or circumlocutory phraseology, have employed the phrase "literal interpretation," by which they denote, not that every word or sentence is to be taken in its rigid literalism, but that the language of the Bible is to be interpreted by the customary rules of grammar and rhetoric, which are used in determining the sense of the "Iliad," "Paradise Lost," and works of human composition.  We are to accept of a strictly literal rendering, unless we have the distinctive marks of figures of speech, when the tropical sense is also received, without *afterward, in addition*, engrafting upon it another and separate sense which is not allowed by the rules of grammar, but which (i.e., last added sense) is applied by many to the Bible, as if the language of that book was not fairly circumscribed by, but formed an exception to, *the universal laws* of language.
> p. 48 Vol. 1 Prop. 4 Obs. 1

>When employing the word "literal," we are to be comprehended as also fully acknowledging the figurative sense, the beautiful ornaments of language; we cordially accept all that is *natural* to language itself, its naked strength and its charming adornments, but object to *additionally* forcing on it a *foreign* element, and enclosing it in a garb that hides its just proportions.
>p. 48 Vol. 1 Prop. 4 Obs. 1

> The Jews, as is well known, while to a large degree holding to a literal interpretation (as e.g. in reference to a literal coming and kingdom of the Messiah, etc.), at the time of the First Advent had fallen more and more into a figurative and allegorizing interpretation, which culminated in the speculative Cabala.

> I here once more repeat, what I have so often insisted on, that the Christian should direct his efforts toward understanding he so-called *literal sense of Scripture, which alone is the substance* of faith and of Christian theology, which alone will sustain him in the hour of trouble and temptation, and which will triumph over sin, death, and the gates of hell, to the praise and glory of God.  The allegorical sense is usually uncertain, and by no means safe to build our faith upon; for it depends for the most part on human opinion only, on which if a man lean he will find it no better than the Egyptian reed.  There Origen, Jerome, and similar of the Fathers *are to be avoided, with the whole of that Alexandrian school which abounds in* this species of interpretation.

> Unbelievers and semi-believers generally advocate that the construction of the Bible is like that of other books, but refuse (Bauer, etc.) to credit the fact that it is diverse from all other books in the authority and truths that it contains.  Our entire argument following shows that we hold it to be above and beyond all other books in the unity of supernatural and Divine things embraced.

> We do not overlook (Obs. 1, note 1) that before the Advent of Jesus the Jews had already, to some extent, departed from this literal interpretation, having adopted an allegorical, mystical system, which was in favor with the Rabbinical portion.  This, however, does not vitiate our argument, which urges the period preceding this introduction, and accepts of the fact that, e.g., in reference to the doctrine of the kingdom, there was no departure from the literal interpretation even among the Rabbinical party.

>  The allegorical interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures cannot be historical proved to have prevailed among the Jews from the time of the exile, or to have been common with the Jews of Palestine at the time of Christ and His apostles.  Although the Sanhedrim and the hearers of Jesus often appealed to the Old Testament, according to the testimony of the New Testament writers, they give no indication of the allegorical interpretation.

> While an ingenious and learned school formed at Alexandria had contrived by a system of allegorical interpretation to infuse Platonism into the Old Testament, the school at Jerusalem had been growing increasingly rigid, and interdicted any such daring exegesis.  It clung with fanatic attachment to the letter of the Scriptures, but failing to comprehend the spirit, it sunk into all the puerilities of a narrow literalism.

> The **history of interpretation** is briefly told. The **first, and Jewish, method** was to abide by the **grammatical sense** (still retained to some extent by the Orthodox -- over against the Reformed or Rationalist -- Jews, and especially by "the Karaites" or "Scripturists"), but as the Jews came in contact with Greek and Oriental philosophy (in Egypt, Greece, etc.), the **effort to conciliate the Hebrew Scriptures with such a philosophy** led to a second mode by which the obvious sense is made figurative in order to convey another sense -- the latter being regarded as the higher.  This brought forth three distinctive types of interpretation: the **grammatical**, the **ideal**, and these two, more or less, combined.  The **Jewish method** -- evidenced by its exclusiveness and Messianic hopes -- was adopted by the primitive Church, as witnessed e.g. by its application of prophecy, its Pre-millenarian views, etc.  The **ideal**, presented in the system of Philo, was inaugurated into the Christian Church by the Alexandrian fathers, and speedily gained a wide-spread reputation, being followed by numerous writers.  A **combination** of the grammatical and ideal found a host of followers down to the Reformation.  Tradition, metaphysical speculations, some favorite for of philosophy, were incorporated.  At the Reformation there was a return to the Jewish method, and while the ideal and mystical has been largely adopted, yet the extremes -- excepting in a few cases -- once so prevailing are now avoided.  As to Philo's system, afterward adopted by Christian fathers (Origen, etc.), we only quote, as illustrative, from an Article entitled "Alexandrian Christianity" (The North Brit. Review, August, 1855) : "According to him (Philo), nearly the whole of Scripture, not only its parables, its symbolic ceremonies, its obscure prophecies, but even the simplest language in which it relates the most ordinary transaction, every name and every number that it contains, possesses not only a plain but also a hidden meaning, the former of which is to the letter as the body to the soul."  After stating that Aristobulus and other Jews, Oriental and Alexandrian, and even Greeks (in application to their poets) had employed this method, the writer adds: "We should say that the adoption of this principle of interpretation by Philo and his Christian disciples was the **greatest obstacle to their discovering the true meaning of the Bible**, and is the cause of their being almost useless as expositors. "

> It is a sad fact that multitudes declare the plain grammatical sense in numerous passages, if received, to be a corruption of the truth.  God is thus virtually charged not merely with surrounding "the kernel" (truth) with "a husk" (error), but (to carry out the figure) with a *poisonous* one !

### Obs. 3
Two passages have been used to attempt to prove that the non-literal sense of interpretation is taught in the Scriptures.

1 Cor. 2:14
But a natural man does not accept the _depths_ of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually examined.

2 Cor. 3:6
who also made us sufficient _as_ ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

> Mysticism, more or less developed, is found in many authors of the present day, although they refuse the extreme of the "Abecedarians," who (Appleton's *Cyclop.*) "held that without the aid of study the Holy Spirit would convey directly to the understanding a knowledge of the Scriptures, and that, therefore, it was better not to know how to read."
>  p.  55 Vol. 1 Prop. 4 Obs. 3 note 3

> Luther, on John 14:25-28, gives an infallible rule for trying the professed (by men) utterances of the Holy Spirit, thus: "If one come, therefore, and present anything to me as taught or revealed by the Holy Spirit, I keep to the Word and hold this doctrine up to it, as to the true touchstone.  If now I see that it agrees with that which Christ says, I receive it as right and good.  But if it be a departure from it, or would produce something different from it, then I say, Thou art not the Holy Ghost, but the detestable devil.  For the true Spirit comes in no other name than in the name of Christ, and teaches nothing other than what the Lord Christ has said."

> The fact is that, to induce the highest certitude, we must receive the authoritative letter as containing the truth, give it its logical force (through reason), and allow its intuitive influence (through a responding moral nature), dependant upon the Spirit that gave the truth, and upon our adaptability for its reception.  God's Word is true, whether men receive or reject it.
