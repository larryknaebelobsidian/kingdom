# Proposition 33. The Prophets, some even before the Captivity, foreseeing the overthrow of the Kingdom, both foretell its downfall and its final restoration.

### Props Mentioned
201

>Thus, e.g., Isaiah, Hosea, Joel, Amos, and Micah deliberately predict the withdrawal of God’s protection as Ruler on account of the rebellious spirit of the nation, the abolishment of the Kingdom, and the destruction of the very place of the Ruler’s special manifestation. But they also announce, just as distinctly, that at some period in the future there shall be *a complete restoration* of the same Kingdom under David’s son, and a restoration, too, pre-eminently glorious.
>p. 240 Vol. 1 Prop. 33
### Examples
>Obs. 1. This, from what preceded and will follow, needs no special proof. Such passages as Amos 9:11, Luke 1:32, 33, Ezek. 37:21, 22, Jer. 33:14, etc., it is admitted by all men, do *in their plain grammatical sense* distinctively teach such downfall and restoration.
>p. 240 Vol. 1 Prop. 33 Obs. 1
### Defeated?
>Obs. 2. Let the reader but pause and consider: God *has had* a veritable Kingdom here on earth; He was the earthly Ruler of the nation exhibited in and through this Kingdom; now is it conceivable that He, owing to unbelief and sin of the nation, will give up this Kingdom *forever*—that He will permit Himself *to be defeated* in the establishment of such an open, outward, manifested Theocracy?
>p. 240 Vol. 1 Prop. 33 Obs. 2
### Kingdom connected with national and religio-political Israel
>Obs. 3. It has been generally acknowledged (no matter how afterward explained or spiritualized) that the basis of prophetical teaching is this Kingdom constantly and uniformly connected with the National and Religio-Political constitution of the people of Israel.
>p. 240 Vol. 1 Prop. 33 Obs. 3
### A change
>Obs. 4. When the elements of disunion, disruption, etc., appeared in the Davidic Kingdom, then also a change took place in the Prophetic voice.
>...
>in view of the now foreseen and determined withdrawal of the Kingdom, much more is said, by way of encouragement under coming trial, respecting the period, when, under the promised Messiah, the Kingdom should be restored never more to end. This was a token of mercy to stimulate the faith and hope of the repentant, pious portion of the nation; for while God withdrew the Kingdom and attendant blessings, He did not, as He promised even by Moses, *utterly* forsake the nation.
