>That, at the time this Kingdom is established and during its continuance, the saints will be under the special influence and power of the Spirit, is clearly taught in many predictions. Even many of our opponents frankly admit that the Millennial descriptions can never be realized without a remarkable, astounding and even miraculous outpouring of the Spirit, exceeding everything that the world has ever witnessed.

>we cordially adopt the doctrine that the Holy Spirit is the renewer and sanctifier, through the truth, of all who are redeemed, and that such renewing influences are necessary unto salvation.

>While accepting of the ordinary work of the Spirit in enlightening and sanctifying men, we do not find that this comes under the phrase “baptism of the Holy Ghost,” which rather denotes the bestowment of all other gifts, even the miraculous, in connection with the ordinary.

>Obs. 2. John the Baptist predicts that the One Coming after him, even Jesus Christ, “shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire” (Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:10; John 1:33; Acts 1:5).

>The baptism then must include something more than the production of “piety,” worship,” “religious principles”—in brief, than the characteristics of a divine life. In turning to the account of the actual reception of this baptism, it is found to embrace the reception of miraculous gifts and powers, such as the imparting supernaturally the understanding of truth, the prophetic spirit, the speaking with other tongues, the working of miracles, etc.

>The uniform testimony of Scripture, wherever the baptism itself is described, is, that it was not designed for the renewing of the heart and conferring of Christian graces (whatever influence it may have exerted in confirming faith and its fruits) but for the bestowal of supernatural power and endowments.

>The fact is indisputable that believers who had been baptized and were acknowledged Christians had by this baptism supernatural power added to their other attainments. It is therefore equivalent to the conferring of such power.

>The Baptism of Pentecost is a pledge of fulfilment in the future, evidencing what the Holy Ghost will yet perform in the coming age.
>Obs. 3

Acts 2:15-20 is
>an earnest of what is yet to come.
>Obs. 3

>it is impossible to “regard Joel’s prediction exhausted, or fully mated in the events of Pentecost.

### Baptism of Holy Spirit in Old Testament
Ezek. 30:27; Isa. 32:15; Ezek. 37:14; Isa. 44:3; Ezek. 39:29; Isa. 59:21,

>The apostle in 2 Cor. 1:22; ch. 5:5; Eph. 1:14, tells believers that they have “the earnest of the Spirit,” which implies that what they now realize through the Spirit is only a kind of first-fruits or pledge of what this same Spirit will perform in “the day of the Lord Jesus.”


>For, in that day both body and soul shall experience this remarkable baptism of the Spirit; the body in the Spirit’s resurrecting, quickening, glorifying power (comp. Rom. 8:11; 2 Cor. 5:15; John 6:63; Eph. 1:13, and 4:20; 1 Pet. 3:18, etc.), and the soul in the Spirit’s conferring wisdom, knowledge, utterance, prophecy, miraculous gifts, etc.

>it was something widely different from the ordinary operations of the Spirit given to form and develop Christian character,

>it is most reasonable to anticipate, as holy men have predicted, an increase of measure, afar more extended manifestation of the Spirit’s almighty energy, etc.
>Obs. 5

>It indicates how the pious wish of Moses (Num. 11:29) may be realized, “would God that all the Lord’s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them.”
>Obs. 5

>Indeed, when we regard the promises of Christ given in this direction to believers, it is impossible to confine them to the present dispensation, seeing that they have not yet been fully realized. Thus e.g. the promise is to everyone that believeth (John 14:12, 13), “the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do,” which in its amplitude undoubtedly extends to the period of this still future predicted outpouring of the Spirit, by which we know, from the evidence already presented in a limited extent, that it is not only possible to be, but that it will be, actually fulfilled.
>Obs. 5


>To be made equal unto angels, to possess the power attributed unto saints, etc., in the very nature of the case, requires the conferring of the Spirit through whom alone those great wonders are performed. When the body of Christ, the elect Church, is completed, then the Oneness, now existing by faith and grace through the Spirit, will be perfected by this superior baptism, in the bodies being made like unto Christ’s, and in the souls possessing divine power, and in their union with Christ as associated rulers and priests performing similar offices and acts. This opens up before us the most astonishing and enrapturing views of the honor, power, and glory of the saints; explaining the source from whence derived; showing how it can be verified, and teaching us that these promises are not exaggerated but sober, joyful realities.
