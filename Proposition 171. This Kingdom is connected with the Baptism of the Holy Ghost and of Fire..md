# Proposition 171. This Kingdom is connected with the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and of Fire.

>That, at the time this Kingdom is established and during its continuance, the saints will be under *the special influence and power of the Spirit*, is clearly taught in many predictions. Even many of our opponents frankly admit that the Millennial descriptions can never be realized without *a remarkable, astounding and even miraculous outpouring of the Spirit*, exceeding everything that the world has ever witnessed.
>p. 64 Vol. 3 Prop. 171

>... we cordially adopt the doctrine that the Holy Spirit is the renewer and sanctifier, through the truth, of all who are redeemed, and that such renewing influences are necessary unto salvation.
>p. 64 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 1

>While accepting of the ordinary work of the Spirit in enlightening and sanctifying men, we do not find that this comes under the phrase “*baptism of the Holy Ghost*,” which rather denotes the bestowment of all other gifts, even the miraculous, *in connection* with the ordinary.
>p. 64 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 1
### Supernatural power
>Obs. 2. John the Baptist predicts that the One Coming after him, even Jesus Christ, “*shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire*” (Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:10; John 1:33; Acts 1:5).
>p. 65 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 2

>The baptism then must include *something more* than the production of “piety,” worship,” “religious principles”—in brief, than the characteristics of a divine life. In turning to the account of the actual reception of this baptism, it is found to embrace the reception of *miraculous gifts and powers*, such as the imparting supernaturally the understanding of truth, the prophetic spirit, the speaking with other tongues, the working of miracles, etc.
>p. 65 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 2

>The uniform testimony of Scripture, wherever the baptism itself is described, is, that it was not designed for the renewing of the heart and conferring of Christian graces (whatever influence it may have exerted in confirming faith and its fruits) but *for the bestowal of supernatural power and endowments*.
>p. 65 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 2

>The fact is *indisputable* that believers who had been baptized and were acknowledged Christians had by this baptism supernatural power *added* to their other attainments. It is therefore *equivalent* to the conferring of such power.
>p. 65 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 2
### A pledge
>The Baptism of Pentecost is a *pledge* of fulfilment in the future, *evidencing* what the Holy Ghost will *yet perform* in the coming age.
>p. 66 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 3

Acts 2:15-20 is
>... *an earnest* of what is yet to come.
>p. 66 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 3

>... it is impossible to regard Joel’s prediction *exhausted, or fully mated* in the events of Pentecost.
>p. 66 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 3

### Baptism of Holy Spirit in Old Testament
Ezek. 30:27; Isa. 32:15; Ezek. 37:14; Isa. 44:3; Ezek. 39:29; Isa. 59:21,
### New Testament
>The apostle in 2 Cor. 1:22; ch. 5:5; Eph. 1:14, tells believers that they have “*the earnest of the Spirit*,” which implies that what they now realize through the Spirit is only *a kind of first-fruits or pledge* of what this same Spirit will perform in “the day of the Lord Jesus.”
>p. 67 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 3

>For, in that day *both body and soul* shall experience this remarkable baptism of the Spirit; the body in the Spirit’s resurrecting, quickening, glorifying power (comp. Rom. 8:11; 2 Cor. 5:15; John 6:63; Eph. 1:13, and 4:20; 1 Pet. 3:18, etc.), and the soul in the Spirit’s conferring wisdom, knowledge, utterance, prophecy, miraculous gifts, etc.
>p. 67-68 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 3

>... it was something *widely different* from the ordinary operations of the Spirit given to form and develop Christian character, ...
>p. 68 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 3
### More extended manifestation of the Spirit's energy
>it is most reasonable to anticipate, as holy men have predicted, *an increase of measure*, afar more extended manifestation of the Spirit’s almighty energy, etc.
>p. 70 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 4

>It indicates how the pious wish of Moses (Num. 11:29) may be realized, “*would God that all the Lord’s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them*.”
>p. 71 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 5

>Indeed, when we regard the promises of Christ given in this direction to believers, it is impossible *to confine* them to the present dispensation, seeing that they have not yet been fully realized. Thus e.g. the promise is to everyone that believeth (John 14:12, 13), “*the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do*,” which in its amplitude undoubtedly extends to the period of this still future predicted outpouring of the Spirit, by which we know, from the evidence already presented in a limited extent, that it is not only possible to be, but that it will be, actually fulfilled.
>p. 71 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 5

>To be made equal unto angels, to possess the power attributed unto saints, etc., in the very nature of the case, requires the conferring of the Spirit through whom *alone* those great wonders are performed. When the body of Christ, the elect Church, is completed, then the Oneness, now existing by faith and grace through the Spirit, will be *perfected* by this superior baptism, in the bodies being made like unto Christ’s, and in the souls possessing divine power, and in their union with Christ as associated rulers and priests performing similar offices and acts. This opens up before us *the most astonishing and enrapturing* views of the honor, power, and glory of the saints; explaining *the source* from whence derived; showing *how* it can be verified, and teaching us that these promises are *not* exaggerated but *sober, joyful realities*.
>p. 71 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 5

### Most remarkable outpouring
>Obs. 6. Hence it is not correct to distinguish this dispensation as one of the Spirit exclusively, or even as pre-eminent over all that shall be given. The very same Spirit manifested His renewing, sanctifying, and even inspiring and miraculous power under the Antediluvian, Patriarchal, and Mosaic dispensations, and now in the Christian He has done this in a still more striking manner. But *to limit* His work to these, is *to ignore* a multitude of blessed predictions, which declare that “the day,” or “the age,” or “the world to come,” is to be emphatically *the great dispensation in which the Spirit will, in the most extraordinary manner, exhibit his power*, so that what has preceded is a mere *earnest* of that which shall follow. His supernatural power will be felt in recreation, in delivering a groaning creation, in raising and quickening the bodies of believers, in qualifying them for their position of kinghood and priesthood, in bestowing Pentecostal gifts, etc.; and hence, seeing that *the perfection and completeness* of His work is only to be witnessed in the coming age, we must attribute the most remarkable outpouring of the Spirit to that future period, thus making *pre-eminently* a dispensation of the Spirit.
>p. 72 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 6
### Sad source of misunderstanding, perversion, extravagances
>It is really sad to observe in looking over the past that, notwithstanding the distinctive description of this baptism and what it confers, it has been *claimed* by a great company, and it has become fruitful of misunderstanding, perversion, and extravagances.
>p. 73 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 7
### Why early church miracles ceased
>Obs. 8. This may throw light upon the disputed point, when authentic miracles ceased, or when this special baptism of the Spirit no longer transpired.
>p. 74 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 8

>... if continued on, perpetuated on in the Church without intermission, the Baptism of the Spirit would have *failed in its significance as a sign, a pledge* of the future fulfilment.
>p. 74 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 8

>... the mistake (which was made, and is now so tenaciously held by the multitude), that all that the prophets predicted related to the present dispensation, and that we need not look for any better here on earth.
>p. 74 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 8

>Besides this, its continuance was unsuitable *both* to the predictions of the prophets and to the times that ensued.
>p. 74 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 8 

>Now the prophecies associate this peculiar outpouring of the Spirit *with* the Jewish nation—it is not isolated from it, but inseparably joined with its restoration, and the period of the restored Theocracy.
>p. 75 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 8
### Aids interpretation of other Scripture
>Obs. 9. It also aids in our interpretation of other Scripture.
>p. 79 Vol. 3 Prop. 171  Obs. 9

### Baptism with fire, the power of judgement
Obs. 12
>To ascertain its meaning, we have only to allow scriptural usage to give us the key which enables us to interpret this promise consistently with *the analogy* of Bible promise, thus avoiding the making it a mere emblem of the Spirit or of His presence, or of His purity and power, or of the reception by believers of affliction instead of happiness, dishonor instead of honor, pain instead of pleasure, and punishment instead of triumph. Fire is employed to denote *the power of judging*, or rather *of executing judgment* upon others.
>p. 80-81 Vol. 3 Prop. 171 Obs. 12
