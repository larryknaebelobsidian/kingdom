>Before showing the latter, the reader ought to determine that the separation of John’s account of “the new heaven and new earth” from its direct relationship to the Millennial age in ch. 20, or the finding it recorded after the account given of that era (and upon which so much stress is laid by *some*), is *no proof whatever* that its realization must also succeed that period. This is so fully granted by many of those who differ from us, that it should not, in itself, be used as an argument against us. It eminently deserves (to avoid confusion, etc.) a separate and distinctive description, which, connected by parallel utterances, sufficiently, as a comparison evinces, identifies the period of its coming.

>As illustrative we select several as follows: Prof. Bush (*Mill*., p. 94) says that it is "in accordance with a feature of the sacred writings of incessant occurrence, in which events, whether historically or symbolically related, *are transposed out of their first chronological order*," and quotes Lightfoot (*Works*, vol. 2, p. 61), "It is a well-known and well-grounded maxim among the Jews, that 'non est prius at posterius in Scriptura.' Their meaning in it is this, that the order and place of a text as it stands in the Bible doth not always infer or enforce *the very time* of the story, which the text relateth; but that sometimes -- nay it occurreth very oft -- stories are laid *out of their natural and chronological place*, and things are very frequently related before which, in order of time, occurred after ; and so 'e contra'. Nor is this transposition and dislocation of times and texts proper to the evangelists only, but the same Spirit that dictated both Testaments alike; laying texts, chapters, and histories out of the proper place in which, according to natural chronological order, they would have lain."  Horne, *Introd*., gives, "On the Interp. of Scrip. Proph.," p. 388, vol. 1, the following rule : "The order of time is *not always to be looked for* in the prophetic writings; for they *frequently resume* topics of which they have formerly treated, after other subjects have intervened, and again discuss them." Victorinus (Apoc. 7:2), one of the earliest expositors, fully recognizes this principle: "The order of the things said is not to be regarded, since often the Holy Spirit, when He has run to the end of the last time, again returns to the same times, and supplies what He has less fully expressed." Many expositors, especially of the Apocalypse, express themselves in the same way, and point out a number of instances (as e.g. the last Seal embracing things under the sixth, ch. 7, ch. 11, ch. 12, ch. 13, ch. 16, ch. 17, etc.) in which events previously referred to are afterward taken up more in detail.  Indeed, however men may differ in the application of the principle in particular instances, every interpreter must, in simple consistency, more or less adopt it.

>*a complete* restoration of all things will not be fully witnessed until the close of the Millennial period.

>On the other hand, we have the most positive proof that so far as “the new heavens,” etc., of John is concerned, they believed it to be fully correspondent with and embracing the Millennial era. Thus e.g. Tertullian (B. 3, *Ag. Martian*, ch. 24) says: “For we also confess, that a Kingdom is promised us on earth: before that in heaven, but in another state, viz., *after the resurrection, for it will be for a thousand years in a city of divine workmanship, viz., Jerusalem brought down from heaven*; and this city Ezekiel knew and *the Apostle John saw*,” etc. After declaring that this is the city for the saints at that time, he closes: “*This is the manner of the heavenly Kingdom*.” Barnabas, in his argument respecting the covenant being fulfilled in the seventh chiliad, makes the latter the Sabbath, the “blessed rest, *when* we have received the righteous promise, *when* iniquity shall be no more, *all things being renewed* (Rev. 21) *by the Lord*, etc. Whatever views the Fathers may have entertained respecting succeeding ages and even changes, it is apparent from their writings that they made no distinction between Isaiah, Peter, and John *on this point*, but quote from all of them directly or inferentially as pertaining to *the same period of time*. They speak of *the perpetuity* of the state introduced at the Millennial era, of *the eternal duration* of the Kingdom then established, and of the everlasting .blessedness then bestowed, and in such comprehensive terms that this “new heaven and earth” enters into the eternal ages *without being destroyed or passing away*. Admitting their liability to error, yet, if sustained by Scripture, a logical consistency, which is to their credit, supports that general unanimity among them.

Obs. 4 should be studied in its entirety

>The phrase “and there was no more sea,” which is supposed to present a serious objection to our view, indicates that the Millennial heaven and earth of Isaiah is denoted. It is gratuitously assumed that because “sea” is sometimes used in its literal sense, it must be literally understood here. But—however the literal to some extent might, for aught we know, accompany it—we find in Dan. 7:2; Ps. 65:7; Rev. 13:1; Ps. 03:3, 4; Hab. 3:8, and numerous places, flood and sea, mighty waters, etc., employed to denote the agitation, unsettled condition, revolutionary tendencies, anarchy, warlike and turbulent commotions of nations. Take this meaning, so emphatically exhibited in prophetic usage, and it is predicted that during this period the nations (showing also that they survive) are disposed to peace under the Theocratic reign of Jesus, thus happily corresponding with many descriptions of the Millennial state which make this peculiarity, freedom from war, etc., a distinguishing excellence. King Jesus “at His appearing and Kingdom” will introduce such an order of things that the turbulence of the sea will be unknown, and war between nations will cease.

>By comparing Rev. chs. 21 and 22 with the Millennial prophecies, as e.g. Isa. chs. 60 and 54, keeping in view the connection of the latter with the Advent and the marriage, we are at no loss to see why, under the teaching of inspired men, the Early Church so universally held that all these prophecies portrayed *a new Jerusalem state here on the earth in the Millennial age*.

>Admitting as we cheerfully do, that the work of God is progressive as it relates to the race and the earth during these thousand years, yet the new heaven and new earth begin with that era, and with it also the New Jerusalem state.

>Let the reader compare e.g. John 14:1-3, fulfilled when Jesus comes again, with 1 Pet. 1:4,5,7,13 realized at the same time, and he must be impressed that the mansions and the inheritance then obtained are eternal, ever-enduring, and not to be superseded by their removal and the substitution of others. But we conclusively show that those mansions and that inheritance are gained at a Pre-Millennial Advent, and hence we insist upon their perpetuity. (Comp. also Prop. 170 on the Father's House.)
