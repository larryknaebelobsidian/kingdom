# Proposition 61. The Kingdom which by promise exclusively belonged to the Jewish nation, the rightful seed of Abraham, was now to be given to an engrafted people.

>It has been shown that this kingdom belongs by promise and covenant to *the seed* of Abraham (Props. 29, 49); now, as the promises of God are sure (Props. 47, 52), this people, this very nation, *must be engrafted or incorporated* with this *elected seed* of Abraham. This is indispensable, for otherwise God’s *oath-bound* word would *fail* in its fulfilment. Bather than have so precious a word to fail, God is able, as we have seen, to raise up children unto Abraham even, if necessary, from the stones (Matt. 3:9); but instead of resorting to miraculous intervention to produce such a result, God raises up a seed unto Abraham *out of* the Gentiles by engrafting them through faith in the Christ, and *accounting them* as the children of Abraham by virtue of their Abrahamic justifying faith.
>p. 396 Vol. 1 Prop 61
### Adoption
>The plan of adoption is simple: Abraham was justified by faith, the election was bestowed upon him in virtue of that faith, and hence those who believe in the promised seed being also justified by faith, are brought into living union with Christ (“the King of the Jews”), and through Him become the adopted children of Abraham who was of like faith. Hence the apostle in Gal. 3 tells us (v. 7) “Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.” But why become the children of Abraham? Because, as he shows, verses 14-18, the promises and inheritance are given through him, and we must be related to Abraham in order to receive and inherit the same. Therefore he goes on and insists that this very essential relationship is established in and through Jesus Christ, and (v. 28, 29) adds: “for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to promise.” Thus then (ch. 2:5) receiving “the adoption of sons,” because united and identified with Christ, who is the chief inheritor under the Abrahamic covenant, we become co-heirs with Him. This marvellously simple arrangement, introducing mercy and grace to us Gentiles, preserves the covenanted promises intact and confirms them.

### We've lost the sense of the need for us to become the children of Abraham
Obs. 2
>multitudes (see. e.g. Prop. 67, Obs. 3, Prop. 54, Obs. 4, 5, etc.) see no necessity for our becoming the seed of Abraham in order to inherit. With many it seems to be the proper thing, to be as far removed as possible from a Jewish standpoint, and to this feeling much and precious truth is sacrificed.
>...
>But we see a deep and solid reason for this process of becoming grafted into this elect, covenanted nation.
### The necessary engrafting of Gentile believers
>Obs. 3. We cannot too strongly insist upon this necessary engrafting of Gentile believers, so that by virtue of a real relationship, they, being regarded by God Himself as of the seed of Abraham, may inherit.
### Ridiculed as "carnal, fleshly" idea of virtually becoming believing Jews
>Obs. 4. Men ridicule as “carnal,” “fleshly,” etc., that we Gentile believers, in virtue of our union with Christ, are grafted in and become members of the Jewish elect nation, virtually becoming believing Jews.
>...
>we must become “Jews inwardly “ thus confirming our position (for what, excepting this covenanted relationship, could have induced Paul to use this peculiar phraseology, viz.: that, in some way, we must become Jews?),
### "Israel"
>Obs. 5. This necessary engrafting, this vital connection through Christ with the Jewish elect nation (as the seed of Abraham to whom the promises are given) gives the key to the word “Israel” applied even now to all true believers.
### Becoming a "child of Abraham" 
>Obs. 6. This necessarily becoming “a child of Abraham” in order to inherit the promises, is unaccountable to those who overlook the covenants by which it is demanded.

>it is only the children of Abraham, natural and adopted, that can obtain the promises.
