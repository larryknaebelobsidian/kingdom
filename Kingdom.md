[Matthew 13:47](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+13&h=40-013-047)

“Again, the **kingdom** of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea, and gathering fish of every kind;

[Matthew 13:52](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+13&h=40-013-052)

And He said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the **kingdom** of heaven is like a head of a household, who brings out of his treasure things new and old.”

[Matthew 16:19](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+16&h=40-016-019)

I will give you the keys of the **kingdom** of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.”

[Matthew 16:28](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+16&h=40-016-028)

“Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His **kingdom**.”

[Matthew 18:1](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+18&h=40-018-001)

At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Who then is greatest in the **kingdom** of heaven?”

[Matthew 18:3](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+18&h=40-018-003)

and said, “Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will never enter the **kingdom** of heaven.

[Matthew 18:4](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+18&h=40-018-004)

Whoever therefore will humble himself as this child, he is the greatest in the **kingdom** of heaven.

[Matthew 18:23](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+18&h=40-018-023)

“For this reason the **kingdom** of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.

[Matthew 19:12](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+19&h=40-019-012)

For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the **kingdom** of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.”

[Matthew 19:14](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+19&h=40-019-014)

But Jesus said, “Let the children alone, and do not hinder them from coming to Me; for the **kingdom** of heaven belongs to such as these.”

[Matthew 19:23](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+19&h=40-019-023)

And Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the **kingdom** of heaven.

[Matthew 19:24](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+19&h=40-019-024)

And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the **kingdom** of God.”

[Matthew 20:1](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+20&h=40-020-001)

“For the **kingdom** of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.

[Matthew 20:21](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+20&h=40-020-021)

And He said to her, “What do you wish?” She said to Him, “Command that in Your **kingdom** these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right and one on Your left.”

[Matthew 21:31](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+21&h=40-021-031)

Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the **kingdom** of God before you.

[Matthew 21:43](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+21&h=40-021-043)

Therefore I say to you, the **kingdom** of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation, producing the fruit of it.

[Matthew 22:2](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+22&h=40-022-002)

“The **kingdom** of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.

[Matthew 23:13](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+23&h=40-023-013)

“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the **kingdom** of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.

[Matthew 24:7](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+24&h=40-024-007)

For nation will rise against nation, and **kingdom** against **kingdom**, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes.

[Matthew 24:14](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+24&h=40-024-014)

And this gospel of the **kingdom** shall be proclaimed in the whole world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.

[Matthew 25:1](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+25&h=40-025-001)

“Then the **kingdom** of heaven may be compared to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.

[Matthew 25:34](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+25&h=40-025-034)

“Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the **kingdom**, which has been prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

[Matthew 26:29](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+26&h=40-026-029)

But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s **kingdom**.”

[Mark 9:1](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+9&h=41-009-001)

And Jesus was saying to them, “Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the **kingdom** of God having come in power.”

[Mark 9:47](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+9&h=41-009-047)

And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out; it is better for you to enter the **kingdom** of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell,

[Mark 10:14](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+10&h=41-010-014)

But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, “Permit the children to come to Me; do not hinder them; for the **kingdom** of God belongs to such as these.

[Mark 10:15](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+10&h=41-010-015)

Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the **kingdom** of God like a child will not enter it at all.”

[Mark 10:23](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+10&h=41-010-023)

And Jesus, looking around, said to His disciples, “How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the **kingdom** of God!”

[Mark 10:24](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+10&h=41-010-024)

And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to them, “Children, how hard it is to enter the **kingdom** of God!

[Mark 10:25](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+10&h=41-010-025)

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the **kingdom** of God.”

[Mark 11:10](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+11&h=41-011-010)

Blessed is the coming **kingdom** of our father David; Hosanna in the highest!”

[Mark 12:34](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+12&h=41-012-034)

And when Jesus saw that he had answered thoughtfully, He said to him, “You are not far from the **kingdom** of God.” After that, no one would dare to ask Him any more questions.

[Mark 13:8](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+13&h=41-013-008)

For nation will rise up against nation, and **kingdom** against **kingdom**; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will also be famines. These things are merely the beginning of birth pains.

[Mark 14:25](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+14&h=41-014-025)

Truly I say to you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the **kingdom** of God.”

[Mark 15:43](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+15&h=41-015-043)

Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent Council member, who himself was waiting for the **kingdom** of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.

[Luke 1:33](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+1&h=42-001-033)

and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of His **kingdom**.”

[Luke 4:5](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+4&h=42-004-005)

And he led Him up and showed Him all the **kingdoms** of the world in a moment of time.

[Luke 4:43](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+4&h=42-004-043)

But He said to them, “I must proclaim the good news of the **kingdom** of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose.”

[Luke 6:20](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+6&h=42-006-020)

And turning His gaze toward His disciples, He began to say, “Blessed are the poor, for yours is the **kingdom** of God.

[Luke 7:28](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+7&h=42-007-028)

I say to you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet he who is least in the **kingdom** of God is greater than he.”

[Luke 8:1](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+8&h=42-008-001)

And it happened that soon afterward He was going around from one city and village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the **kingdom** of God. The twelve were with Him,

[Luke 8:10](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+8&h=42-008-010)

And He said, “To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the **kingdom** of God, but to the rest it is in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.

[Luke 9:2](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+9&h=42-009-002)

And He sent them out to preach the **kingdom** of God and to heal the sick.

[Luke 9:11](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+9&h=42-009-011)

But when the crowds became aware of this, they followed Him; and welcoming them, He began speaking to them about the **kingdom** of God and curing those who had need of healing.

[Luke 9:27](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+9&h=42-009-027)

But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the **kingdom** of God.”

[Luke 9:60](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+9&h=42-009-060)

But He said to him, “Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the **kingdom** of God.”

[Luke 9:62](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+9&h=42-009-062)

But Jesus said to him, “No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the **kingdom** of God.”

[Luke 10:9](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+10&h=42-010-009)

and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them, ‘The **kingdom** of God has come near to you.’

[Luke 10:11](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+10&h=42-010-011)

‘Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off against you; yet know this, that the **kingdom** of God is at hand.’

[Luke 11:2](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+11&h=42-011-002)

And He said to them, “When you pray, say: ‘Father, hallowed be Your name. Your **kingdom** come.

[Luke 11:17](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+11&h=42-011-017)

But He knew their thoughts and said to them, “Any **kingdom** divided against itself is laid waste, and a house divided against itself falls.

[Luke 11:18](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+11&h=42-011-018)

But if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his **kingdom** stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.

[Luke 11:20](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+11&h=42-011-020)

But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the **kingdom** of God has come upon you.

[Luke 12:31](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+12&h=42-012-031)

But seek His **kingdom**, and these things will be added to you.

[Luke 12:32](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+12&h=42-012-032)

Do not fear, little flock, for your Father is well pleased to give you the **kingdom**.

[Luke 13:18](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+13&h=42-013-018)

Therefore, He was saying, “What is the **kingdom** of God like, and to what shall I compare it?

[Luke 13:20](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+13&h=42-013-020)

And again He said, “To what shall I compare the **kingdom** of God?

[Luke 13:28](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+13&h=42-013-028)

In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the **kingdom** of God, but yourselves being cast out.

[Luke 13:29](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+13&h=42-013-029)

And they will come from east and west and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the **kingdom** of God.

[Luke 14:15](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+14&h=42-014-015)

But when one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this, he said to Him, “Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the **kingdom** of God!”

[Luke 16:16](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+16&h=42-016-016)

“The Law and the Prophets were until John; since that time the good news of the **kingdom** of God is proclaimed, and everyone is forcing his way into it.

[Luke 17:20](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+17&h=42-017-020)

Now having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the **kingdom** of God was coming, He answered them and said, “The **kingdom** of God is not coming with signs to be observed,

[Luke 17:21](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+17&h=42-017-021)

nor will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘There!’ For behold, the **kingdom** of God is in your midst.”

[Luke 18:16](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+18&h=42-018-016)

But Jesus called for them, saying, “Permit the children to come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the **kingdom** of God belongs to such as these.

[Luke 18:17](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+18&h=42-018-017)

Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the **kingdom** of God like a child will never enter it.”

[Luke 18:24](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+18&h=42-018-024)

And Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the **kingdom** of God!

[Luke 18:25](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+18&h=42-018-025)

For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the **kingdom** of God.”

[Luke 18:29](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+18&h=42-018-029)

And He said to them, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the **kingdom** of God,

[Luke 19:11](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+19&h=42-019-011)

Now while they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they thought that the **kingdom** of God was going to appear immediately.

[Luke 19:12](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+19&h=42-019-012)

So He said, “A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a **kingdom** for himself, and then return.

[Luke 19:15](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+19&h=42-019-015)

And it happened that when he returned, after receiving the **kingdom**, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him so that he might know how much they had made in business.

[Luke 21:10](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+21&h=42-021-010)

Then He continued saying to them, “Nation will rise against nation and **kingdom** against **kingdom**,

[Luke 21:31](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+21&h=42-021-031)

So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the **kingdom** of God is near.

[Luke 22:16](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+22&h=42-022-016)

for I say to you, I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the **kingdom** of God.”

[Luke 22:18](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+22&h=42-022-018)

For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the **kingdom** of God comes.”

[Luke 22:29](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+22&h=42-022-029)

and I grant you a **kingdom**, just as My Father granted one to Me,

[Luke 22:30](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+22&h=42-022-030)

that you may eat and drink at My table in My **kingdom**, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

[Luke 23:42](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+23&h=42-023-042)

And he was saying, “Jesus, remember me when You come in Your **kingdom**!”

[Luke 23:51](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+23&h=42-023-051)

(he had not consented to their counsel and action), a man from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the **kingdom** of God;

[John 3:3](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=John+3&h=43-003-003)

Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the **kingdom** of God.”

[John 3:5](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=John+3&h=43-003-005)

Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the **kingdom** of God.

[John 18:36](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=John+18&h=43-018-036)

Jesus answered, “My **kingdom** is not of this world. If My **kingdom** were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I would not be delivered over to the Jews; but as it is, My **kingdom** is not from here.”
## Acts - 8

[Acts 1:3](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Acts+1&h=44-001-003)

to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over forty days and speaking about the things concerning the **kingdom** of God.

[Acts 1:6](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Acts+1&h=44-001-006)

So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the **kingdom** to Israel?”

[Acts 8:12](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Acts+8&h=44-008-012)

But when they believed Philip proclaiming the good news about the **kingdom** of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, both men and women.

[Acts 14:22](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Acts+14&h=44-014-022)

strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, “Through many afflictions we must enter the **kingdom** of God.”

[Acts 19:8](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Acts+19&h=44-019-008)

And after he entered the synagogue, he continued speaking out boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them about the **kingdom** of God.

[Acts 20:25](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Acts+20&h=44-020-025)

“And now, behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the **kingdom**, will no longer see my face.

[Acts 28:23](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Acts+28&h=44-028-023)

And when they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers; and he was explaining to them by solemnly bearing witness about the **kingdom** of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening.

[Acts 28:31](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Acts+28&h=44-028-031)

preaching the **kingdom** of God and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, unhindered.

## Paul - 14
[  
Romans 14:17](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Romans+14&h=45-014-017)

for the **kingdom** of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 4:20](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=1+Corinthians+4&h=46-004-020)

For the **kingdom** of God does not consist in words but in power.

[1 Corinthians 6:9](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=1+Corinthians+6&h=46-006-009)

Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the **kingdom** of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,

[1 Corinthians 6:10](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=1+Corinthians+6&h=46-006-010)

nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the **kingdom** of God.

[1 Corinthians 15:24](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=1+Corinthians+15&h=46-015-024)

Then comes the end, when He hands over the **kingdom** to the God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.

[1 Corinthians 15:50](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=1+Corinthians+15&h=46-015-050)

Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the **kingdom** of God, nor does the corruptible inherit the incorruptible.

[Galatians 5:21](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Galatians+5&h=48-005-021)

envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the **kingdom** of God.

[Ephesians 5:5](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Ephesians+5&h=49-005-005)

For this you know with certainty, that no one sexually immoral or impure or greedy, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the **kingdom** of Christ and God.

[Colossians 1:13](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Colossians+1&h=51-001-013)

Who rescued us from the authority of darkness, and transferred us to the **kingdom** of the Son of His love,

[Colossians 4:11](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Colossians+4&h=51-004-011)

and also Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only fellow workers for the **kingdom** of God who are from the circumcision, and they have proved to be a comfort to me.

[1 Thessalonians 2:12](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=1+Thessalonians+2&h=52-002-012)

so that you would walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own **kingdom** and glory.

[2 Thessalonians 1:5](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=2+Thessalonians+1&h=53-001-005)

This is a plain indication of God’s righteous judgment so that you will be considered worthy of the **kingdom** of God, for which indeed you are suffering.

[2 Timothy 4:1](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=2+Timothy+4&h=55-004-001)

[2 Timothy 4:18](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=2+Timothy+4&h=55-004-018)

The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will save me unto His heavenly **kingdom**; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

## General Epistles - 14

[Hebrews 1:8](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Hebrews+1&h=58-001-008)

But of the Son He says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, And the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your **kingdom**.

[Hebrews 11:33](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Hebrews+11&h=58-011-033)

who through faith conquered **kingdoms**, performed righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,

[Hebrews 12:28](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Hebrews+12&h=58-012-028)

Therefore, since we are receiving a **kingdom** which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe;

[James 2:5](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=James+2&h=59-002-005)

Listen, my beloved brothers: did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the **kingdom** which He promised to those who love Him?

[2 Peter 1:11](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=2+Peter+1&h=61-001-011)
