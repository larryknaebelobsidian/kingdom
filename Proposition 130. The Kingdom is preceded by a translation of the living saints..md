# Proposition 130. The Kingdom is preceded by a translation of the living saints.
### Props Mentioned
[[Proposition 126. In confirmation of our position, the Old Testament clearly teaches a Pre-Millennial resurrection of the saints.|126]] [[Proposition 127. In support of our view, the Apocalypse unmistakably teaches a Pre-Millennial resurrection of the saints.|127]] [[Proposition 128. The language of the Gospels and Epistles is in strict accord with the requirements of a Pre-Millennial resurrection.|128]] [[Proposition 129. The Jewish view of a Pre-Mill, resurrection requisite for the introduction of the Messianic Kingdom is fully sustained by the grammatical sense of the New Testament.|129]] [[Proposition 181. Our doctrinal position illustrated and enforced by the Parable of the Ten Virgins.|181]] 

PERSONAL NOTE: This topic requires much prayer and study. 

Mar. 2023, I find several details of this proposition foreign to me.  Marking them in the book with ?. - p. 314

Personal Note: My view, before reading Peters, is that the Bible word "rapture" only applies to living saints.  Peters uses the word translation.  I currently believe there to be one gathering event (2 Thess. 2:1) of believers at the Second Coming of Christ; the dead believers are raised first and then the living believers are raptured, and together they meet the Lord in the clouds. This happens when "the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God" (1 Thess. 4:16) 

>This is a *prerequisite*, in order that those accounted worthy to inherit the Kingdom, and rule the nations with Christ, may be gathered. In reference to the dead saints, a Pre-Mill, resurrection (Props. 126-129) is promised by which to attain this object; and with such a resurrection (i.e. at that time) a translation of the living saints is also connected in 1 Thess. 4:17, “*the dead in Christ shall rise first* (or away); *then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds* (or, in clouds) *to meet the Lord in the air*," etc. The same is repeated in 1 Cor. 15:61, 52, in union only with the resurrection of believers: “*Behold, I shew you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed*," etc.
>p. 314 Vol 2 Prop 130
### Private Resurrection
>Thus e.g. the common view that the resurrection will be a public affair, to be witnessed by the world, is now discarded as untenable in the light of Christ’s (also pertaining to “the first-fruits”) resurrection, which was *strictly private*. It is now held, and properly, that the members will be raised *like* the Head was (for if a public resurrection, humanly speaking, is desirable, then surely it ought to nave been that of Christ’s), in order that the preparatory events for the coming judgment of the world may be introduced in such a manner (privately) as to establish “*the snare*” and “*the net*” intended for the unbelieving and wicked.
>p. 314-315 Vol 2 Prop 130 Obs. 1
### Invisible Resurrection
>Leading prophetical writers justly have no hesitancy in asserting that no mortal eye of unbelief shall behold the resurrection.
>p. 315 Vol 2 Prop 130 Obs. 1
### Invisible Translation
>This at once places the translation of the saints in a new aspect, and indicates, as it accompanies accompanies the resurrection, that it also is unseen (like Enoch’s and Elijah’s) by the world.
>p. 315 Vol 2 Prop 130 Obs. 1
### Rev. 20 Resurrection of Great Tribulation Saints Only
>Again, careful students of the Word felt satisfied that the resurrection of the saints in Rev. 20:4-6 was *specifically* that of those who passed through *the great* tribulation under the culminated Antichrist, and was *preceded* by that of others, as implied in Rev. 14:1-6, etc.
>p. 315 Vol 2 Prop 130 Obs. 1
### First not in time but in privilege
> " The word "first" applied to the resurrection has reference not to its being first in time (which would be incorrect, seeing that Christ's res. and that of saints, Matt. 27:52,53, preceded), but of its being a resurrection which *also* brings those who participated in it *within* the privileges of "the first-born", viz., a double portion, Deut. 21:17;  priesthood, Num. 3:13; and government or dominion, Gen. 27:29. The subject of the resurrection, for a long time, was not clear to the writer until he observed the real scriptural application of the word "first, " as just given."
> p. 315 Vol 2 Prop 130 Obs. 1 
### One Coming but a Series of Acts
> Again, "prophetical writers are also agreed that what is called the Sec. Advent (the Advent itself as distinguished from the reign and Kingdom that follows) is not to be regarded as simple one act, but embracing a series of acts connected with the one Coming (for when Jesus comes again He remains upon earth).  That is, the Sec. Advent is to be considered more in the light of the First Advent (which latter embraced not less than thirty-three years, and numerous acts predicted as related to His coming), as something which, owing to a variety of things prophesied concerning it, cannot possibly be limited to a few years." 
> p. 315 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

> "Comparing all the events that are included in the Sec. Advent, it is simply impossible, without great violation of order, etc., to crowd them all together as the instantaneous resultants of such a Coming." 
> p. 315 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

> "This, then, impresses caution in not compressing what is intimated concerning the translation or removal of saints necessarily to one transaction or day" 
> p. 315 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1
### Over a Period of Time
> ... "writers now generally attribute to this introductory manifestation a period of seven years, or forty years, and of (thirty and forty conjoined) seventy years. (Considering the events to follow the Advent before the overthrow of Antichrist, such as the development of the confederation, the return of a portion of the Jews to Palestine, the doom of the harlot, etc., the longer periods are preferable)" 
> p. 315 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1
### 7, 40, 70 years
>Again, analogy favors the removal of the righteous in a time of severe and terrible judgment intended for the wicked, as in the case of Noah, Lot, the early believers at Jerusalem, etc., while previous translations are not lacking, as in the case of Enoch and Elijah.
>p. 315-316 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1
### Removal for deliverance and preparation
>The Second Advent inaugurates a series of most tremendous judgments, both upon the Church and the world—so terrific that they are constantly pointed out as *the culmination of God’s wrath*—and it is reasonable to suppose, judging from God’s past dealings, that He again will grant *special deliverance* to those who are devoted to Him. At this time also, the removal being designed not only to save out of tribulation, but to prepare the saints, deemed worthy of it, *for promised rulership then to be instituted, and for joint participation* in the administration of judgments upon the nations, a translation accompanied by the same transforming change, glorification, which the resurrected saints experience, is precisely that which we ought to anticipate.
>p. 316 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

### Begins in 'the night'
> "It is universally admitted by Millenarians that "the day of the Lord Jesus" is preceded not only by "a morning", but that it virtually begins in "the night"; Christ representing His Coming to be when it is yet "night", He being "the morning star", which ushers in "the morning" of the glorious day." 
> p. 316 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

> "This refers the resurrection and translation of a chosen body to "the night", i.e. to the close of this dispensation, as preparatory to the introduction of an incoming one." 
> p. 316 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

>Again, critical writers in investigating 2 Thess. 2:2 have shown that the word translated “is at hand” (in the phrase “the day of Christ (or Lord) is at hand”) means, correctly rendered, “is come or “has come,” i.e. is something already present, and not something still future. This correctly explains the trouble and alarm of the Thessalonian brethren, who were certainly not afraid of “the blessed hope,” which Paul says they waited for (1 Thess. 1:10), and for which they were prepared (1 Thess. 2:19 and 3:13, and 5:4, 5), but apprehending that “the day of Christ” had already come, and they not having experienced the promised translation, and their pious dead being still with them without an experienced resurrection, they were troubled and distressed at the thought. Those brethren with hearts full of love for the Saviour were not so fearful that they would desire and pray (as multitudes now) that the blessed Lord should delay His Coming, but, in some way misapprehending the real state of affairs, they believed that the initiatory proceedings belonging to the day of Christ had already commenced, and that they and their pious dead were left without realizing the exceeding precious promises given to them. This simple change in a single word, supported too by the strongest of evidence, explains not only the cause of the Thessalonians’ trouble (which Paul proceeds to remove by showing that an apostasy must first come to develop into the predicted Antichrist, implying that such an apostasy with its result necessarily required time, still in the future, before “the day of Christ” came), but throws much light, corroborative, on the subject of the resurrection and the translation of the saints. For, to cause such trouble they must have believed that” the day of Christ” would be inaugurated by preliminaries unseen by the world, and that the resurrection and translation would both be invisible, and they, not participating were doomed to terrible tribulation, or that the predictions were false.
>p. 316-317 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

### FOR and WITH
Jesus coming "for or in behalf" of His saints (1 Thess. 3:14-17; 1 Cor. 15:51,52) and Jesus coming "with all" His saints (Zech. 14:5; Rev. 19:14; 1 Thess. 3:13; Jude 14,15)

| FOR His saints 1 Th. 3:14-17; 1 Cor. 15:51-52                                 |     | WITH His saints Zech. 14:5; Rev. 19:14; 1 Th. 3:13; Jude 14,15 |

### Vultures
Luke 17:34-37 - Translation

eagles/vultures - saints
body - followers of the antichrist

### Partial
### ***One class of believers kept from the great tribulation and another class goes into it.***

Rev 7 - 144,000 - note: Peters says this 144,000 is a different group than the 144,000 of chapter 14

Rev 7 - great multitude from every nation

### Hiding
> This distinction in point of favor is marked by still another set of passages which describe *the hiding* of the saints when this time of trouble, this storm of persecution and fury bursts upon the Church and world.
> p. 325 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 5
### Translation will be unwitnessed but known to the nations.
> It is likely, however, from the consultation of the wicked against them, that while the removal is allowed it will be attributed to natural causes, or to a concerted movement, and that all reference to its supernatural occurrence will be stoutly denied. 
> p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 6

> In all probability, "*the sign of the Son of Man*" (Matt. 24:30) will be something connected with this translation ... 
> p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 6
### Multiple Translations
> ... *this astonishing [[removal of certain chosen ones]], accounted worthy*, owing to their distinctive faith in God's promises, *to escape*.
> p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 7

> ... surely those who believe in God's Word and are [[left behind]] will be most wonderfully affected by the event. 
> p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 7

> (The writer has *often, often felt* that it is *specially* for this period that he is laboring, when his work will be appreciated, etc.) 
>  p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 7

> The Church, *then* starting up with Abrahamic faith *will recognize its chronological position*, will *see what* is before it, and, energetically infused by fear and hope, *prepare itself* for the fearful ordeal through which it must pass. And we are assured that the Church in this contest, overpowered as she will be, will sustain the persecution *with triumphant faith*, feeling convinced from the events occurring and the time elapsed, that the Son of Man is even *already present*, waiting for the moment of direct interference." (p. 327-328 Vol 2)
> p. 327-328 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 7

***Peters believes that the majority of Christians (but not all) will be [[left behind]] to experience the tribulation***
### Restrainer
The Restrainer 2 Thess 2:6,7

Peters suggests Theodoret's opinion is perhaps correct: "the decree of God's Providence"

### Two Translations
Peters believes there will be 2 translations: before ("[[the first-fruits]]") and after ("[[the harvest]]") the great tribulation (p. 329 Vol 2 )
