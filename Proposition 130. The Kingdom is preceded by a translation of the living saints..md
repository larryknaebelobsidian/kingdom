# Proposition 130. The Kingdom is preceded by a translation of the living saints.
### Props Mentioned
81 114 121 123 [126](Proposition%20126.%20In%20confirmation%20of%20our%20position,%20the%20Old%20Testament%20clearly%20teaches%20a%20Pre-Millennial%20resurrection%20of%20the%20saints..md) [127](Proposition%20127.%20In%20support%20of%20our%20view,%20the%20Apocalypse%20unmistakably%20teaches%20a%20Pre-Millennial%20resurrection%20of%20the%20saints..md) [128](Proposition%20128.%20The%20language%20of%20the%20Gospels%20and%20Epistles%20is%20in%20strict%20accord%20with%20the%20requirements%20of%20a%20Pre-Millennial%20resurrection..md) [129](Proposition%20129.%20The%20Jewish%20view%20of%20a%20Pre-Mill,%20resurrection%20requisite%20for%20the%20introduction%20of%20the%20Messianic%20Kingdom%20is%20fully%20sustained%20by%20the%20grammatical%20sense%20of%20the%20New%20Testament..md) 135 154 160 161 162 163 164 166 169 173 174 177 [181](Proposition%20181.%20Our%20doctrinal%20position%20illustrated%20and%20enforced%20by%20the%20Parable%20of%20the%20Ten%20Virgins..md) 
## Prerequisite
>This is a *prerequisite*, in order that those accounted worthy to inherit the Kingdom, and rule the nations with Christ, may be gathered. In reference to the dead saints, a Pre-Mill, resurrection (Props. 126-129) is promised by which to attain this object; and with such a resurrection (i.e. at that time) a translation of the living saints is also connected in 1 Thess. 4:17, “*the dead in Christ shall rise first* (or away); *then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds* (or, in clouds) *to meet the Lord in the air*," etc. The same is repeated in 1 Cor. 15:61, 52, in union only with the resurrection of believers: “*Behold, I shew you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed*," etc.
>p. 314 Vol 2 Prop 130

### Important Additions
>Obs. 1. While all writers on prophecy insist upon the translation of living saints at the Advent of Jesus, and the Millenarian authors direct especial attention to it; while it was a special object of hope and desire to the early believers and to succeeding ones, it is only more recently, since eschatology has received remarkable study and investigation, that *important additions* (resulting from comparing Scripture with Scripture) have been made to our knowledge respecting it. Our work would be incomplete without noticing this feature, and adding something to a subject imperfectly comprehended by many.
>p. 314 Vol. 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

See Cautions note regarding the above statement.
### Private Resurrection
>Thus e.g. the common view that the resurrection will be a public affair, to be witnessed by the world, is now discarded as untenable in the light of Christ’s (also pertaining to “the first-fruits”) resurrection, which was *strictly private*. It is now held, and properly, that the members will be raised *like* the Head was (for if a public resurrection, humanly speaking, is desirable, then surely it ought to have been that of Christ’s), in order that the preparatory events for the coming judgment of the world may be introduced in such a manner (privately) as to establish “*the snare*” and “*the net*” intended for the unbelieving and wicked.
>p. 314-315 Vol 2 Prop 130 Obs. 1

See Cautions note regarding the above statement.
### Invisible Resurrection
>Leading prophetical writers justly have no hesitancy in asserting that no mortal eye of unbelief shall behold the resurrection.
>p. 315 Vol 2 Prop 130 Obs. 1
### Invisible Translation
>This at once places the translation of the saints in a new aspect, and indicates, as it accompanies the resurrection, that it also is unseen (like Enoch’s and Elijah’s) by the world.
>p. 315 Vol 2 Prop 130 Obs. 1
### Rev. 20 Resurrection of Great Tribulation Saints Only
>Again, careful students of the Word felt satisfied that the resurrection of the saints in Rev. 20:4-6 was *specifically* that of those who passed through *the great* tribulation under the culminated Antichrist, and was *preceded* by that of others, as implied in Rev. 14:1-6, etc.
>p. 315 Vol 2 Prop 130 Obs. 1
### First not in time but in privilege
> The word "first" applied to the resurrection has reference not to its being first in time (which would be incorrect, seeing that Christ's res. and that of saints, Matt. 27:52,53, preceded), but of its being a resurrection which *also* brings those who participated in it *within* the privileges of "the first-born", viz., a double portion, Deut. 21:17;  priesthood, Num. 3:13; and government or dominion, Gen. 27:29. The subject of the resurrection, for a long time, was not clear to the writer until he observed the real scriptural application of the word "first, " as just given.
> p. 315 Vol 2 Prop 130 Obs. 1 
### One Coming but a Series of Acts
> Again, "prophetical writers are also agreed that what is called the Sec. Advent (the Advent itself as distinguished from the reign and Kingdom that follows) is not to be regarded as simply one act, but embracing a series of acts connected with the one Coming (for when Jesus comes again He remains upon earth).  That is, the Sec. Advent is to be considered more in the light of the First Advent (which latter embraced not less than thirty-three years, and numerous acts predicted as related to His coming), as something which, owing to a variety of things prophesied concerning it, cannot possibly be limited to a few years." 
> p. 315 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

> "Comparing all the events that are included in the Sec. Advent, it is simply impossible, without great violation of order, etc., to crowd them all together as the instantaneous resultants of such a Coming." 
> p. 315 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

> "This, then, impresses caution in not compressing what is intimated concerning the translation or removal of saints necessarily to one transaction or day" 
> p. 315 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1
### Over a Period of Time - 7, 40, 70 years
> ... "writers now generally attribute to this introductory manifestation a period of seven years, or forty years, and of (thirty and forty conjoined) seventy years. (Considering the events to follow the Advent before the overthrow of Antichrist, such as the development of the confederation, the return of a portion of the Jews to Palestine, the doom of the harlot, etc., the longer periods are preferable)" 
> p. 315 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1
### Removal for deliverance and preparation
>Again, analogy favors the removal of the righteous in a time of severe and terrible judgment intended for the wicked, as in the case of Noah, Lot, the early believers at Jerusalem, etc., while previous translations are not lacking, as in the case of Enoch and Elijah.
>p. 315-316 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

>The Second Advent inaugurates a series of most tremendous judgments, both upon the Church and the world—so terrific that they are constantly pointed out as *the culmination of God’s wrath*—and it is reasonable to suppose, judging from God’s past dealings, that He again will grant *special deliverance* to those who are devoted to Him. At this time also, the removal being designed not only to save out of tribulation, but to prepare the saints, deemed worthy of it, *for promised rulership then to be instituted, and for joint participation* in the administration of judgments upon the nations, a translation accompanied by the same transforming change, glorification, which the resurrected saints experience, is precisely that which we ought to anticipate.
>p. 316 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

### Begins in 'the night'
> "It is universally admitted by Millenarians that "the day of the Lord Jesus" is preceded not only by "*a morning*", but that it virtually begins in "*the night*"; Christ representing His Coming to be when it is yet "*night*", He being "*the morning star*", which ushers in "*the morning*" of the glorious day." 
> p. 316 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1

> "This refers the resurrection and translation of a chosen body to "*the night*", i.e. to the close of this dispensation, as preparatory to the introduction of an incoming one." 
> p. 316 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 1
### The day has come
>Again, critical writers in investigating 2 Thess. 2:2 have shown that the word translated “*is at hand*” (in the phrase “*the day of Christ* (or Lord) *is at hand*”) means, correctly rendered, “*is come*," or “*has come*,” i.e. is something *already* present, and *not* something still future. This correctly explains the trouble and alarm of the Thessalonian brethren, who were certainly not afraid of “the blessed hope,” which Paul says they waited for (1 Thess. 1:10), and for which they were prepared (1 Thess. 2:19 and 3:13, and 5:4, 5), but apprehending that “the day of Christ” had *already come*, and they *not having experienced* the promised translation, and their pious dead being still with them without an experienced resurrection, they were *troubled and distressed* at the thought. Those brethren with hearts full of love for the Saviour were not so fearful that they would desire and pray (as multitudes now) that the blessed Lord *should delay* His Coming, but, in some way misapprehending the real state of affairs, they believed that the initiatory proceedings belonging to the day of Christ *had already commenced*, and that they and their pious dead *were left without realizing* the exceeding precious promises given to them. This simple change in a single word, supported too by the strongest of evidence, explains not only the cause of the Thessalonians’ trouble (which Paul proceeds to remove by showing that an apostasy must *first come* to develop into the predicted Antichrist, implying that such an apostasy with its result necessarily required time, still in the future, before “the day of Christ” came), but throws much light, corroborative, on the subject of the resurrection and the translation of the saints. For, to cause such trouble they must have believed that” the day of Christ” would be inaugurated by *preliminaries unseen* by the world, and that the resurrection and translation would *both be invisible*, and they, not participating were doomed to terrible tribulation, or that the predictions were false. We say nothing respecting the source from whence they derived such thoughts, but one thing is impressive, viz., that the Apostle does not correct *such impressions*, but rather by his silence confirms them in them. Yea, more, in beseeching them “by our gathering together unto Him,” he *virtually indorses* the views entertained by them respecting this gathering.

### FOR and WITH
p. 318-319 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 2 

**Typo correction**: This observation has a typo of one bible reference. Although I left the references unchanged below, please mentally replace 1 Thess. 3:14-17 with 1 Thess. 4:14-17. 1 Thess. 3 only has 13 verses.

Jesus coming "for or in behalf" of His saints (1 Thess. 3:14-17; 1 Cor. 15:51,52) and Jesus coming "with all" His saints (Zech. 14:5; Rev. 19:14; 1 Thess. 3:13; Jude 14,15)

### One taken, one left
>Obs. 3. We now come to a passage which directly teaches a translation, viz., Luke 17:34-37, “*I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other left. Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken and the other left And they answered and said unto Him, Where, Lord? And He said unto them: Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together*” (see Matt. 24:28).
>p. 319 Vol 2 Prop. 130  Obs. 3 
### Vultures
p. 319-322 Vol 2 Prop. 130  Obs. 3 
I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.35 There will be two women grinding _grain_ at the same place; one will be taken and the other will be left.36 [Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left.”]37 And answering they said to Him, “Where, Lord?” And He said to them, “Where the body _is,_ there also the vultures will be gathered.”
Luke 17:34-37 - LSB

eagles/vultures - saints
body - followers of the antichrist
### Partial resurrection/translation
p. 322-325 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 4 
***One class of believers kept from the great tribulation and another class goes into it.***

Rev 7 - 144,000 - note: Peters says this 144,000 is a different group than the 144,000 of chapter 14

Rev 7 - great multitude from every nation

### Hiding
> This distinction in point of favor is marked by still another set of passages which describe *the hiding* of the saints when this time of trouble, this storm of persecution and fury bursts upon the Church and world.
> p. 325 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 5
### Translation will be unwitnessed but known to the nations.
> It is likely, however, from the consultation of the wicked against them, that while the removal is allowed it will be attributed to natural causes, or to a concerted movement, and that all reference to its supernatural occurrence will be stoutly denied. 
> p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 6
### The Sign of the Son of Man
> In all probability, "*the sign of the Son of Man*" (Matt. 24:30) will be something connected with this translation (for events belonging to one period of time are grouped together without giving in every particular the exact order, as e.g. Isa. 25:6-9, etc.). The sign is one thing and the open visible Coming is another, and yet being a sign directly pertaining to the Son of Man, it relates to Him as in something connected with the Theocratic (see Prop. 81) ordering. Now, let this removal of the saints take place as described by Paul, John, etc., in the night, accompanied by a shout and trump (i.e. events may be denoted— see Obs. below); let the Son of Man be “*in the air*” to receive His risen and translated ones, and as the night advances around the earth, so let Him proceed around this globe in the process of gathering—such will be the accompaniments and the appearance in the sky, that, however explained by the world as electrical, meteorical, etc., it will constitute a sign, and a most impressive one, of the Son of Man. Invisible Himself, sheltered behind the curtains of the bright enveloping clouds, yet His Presence in the air may be exhibited by tokens never before witnessed.
> p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 6

>See Prop. 174, where this sign is noticed more at length. It may be added here that if the sign does not refer to a peculiar and striking manifestation in the sky itself, then it may relate to the resurrection, translation, and withdrawal of the saints themselves, such being an indication or sign of "the Son of Man," i.e. of His presence. Or it may (as we can only at best conjecture) denote that the assembling at Mt. Sinai (Prop. 166) is such a sign -- indicative of a previous resurrection and translation by "the Son of Man".
>p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 6 Note 
### Effect of hidden translation on the Church
>Obs. 7. The *effect* that this translation will have upon the Church is remarkably corroborative of our position. If we turn to Rev. 14 it is stated that *immediately after* the removal of “the first-fruits” there will be *a most powerful renewed* preaching of the Word of God, deriving its force from a proclamation of the *now certain* coming judgments of God and tribulation under the Antichrist. What causes *such a change* in the style of the preaching, which will result in the conversion, as parallel passages show, of very many, preparing them to pass through the great tribulation, and to suffer death rather than to worship the Beast and his image? Nothing less than *this astonishing removal of certain chosen ones, accounted worthy*, owing to their distinctive faith in God's promises, *to escape*.
> p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 7

> ... surely those who believe in God's Word and are left behind will be *most wonderfully affected* by the event. 
> p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 7

> (The writer has *often, often felt* that it is *specially* for this period that he is laboring, when his work will be appreciated, etc.) 
>  p. 327 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 7

> The Church, *then* starting up with Abrahamic faith *will recognize its chronological position*, will *see what* is before it, and, energetically infused by fear and hope, *prepare itself* for the fearful ordeal through which it must pass. And we are assured that the Church in this contest, overpowered as she will be, will sustain the persecution *with triumphant faith*, feeling convinced from the events occurring and the time elapsed, that the Son of Man is even *already present*, waiting for the moment of direct interference." (p. 327-328 Vol 2)
> p. 327-328 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 7

***Peters believes that the majority of Christians (but not all) will be left behind to experience the tribulation***

### Terrific persecution
>Obs. 8. It has been aptly remarked that the removal of righteous persons has been followed (as e.g. Enoch, Noah, Lot, at Jerusalem, etc.) by the outpourings of God’s judgments, and the principle is taught e.g. in the sealing of the 144,000 (Rev. 7). A comparison of Scripture teaches that when this translation is experienced, then will rapidly arise that culminated head of Antichrist which will overwhelm the Church with terrific persecution.   
>p. 328 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 8
### Restrainer
2 Thess 2:6,7
6 And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed. 7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains _will do so_ until he is taken out of the way.

Peters suggests Theodoret's opinion is perhaps correct in identifying the restrainer as: "the decree of God's Providence"
p. 328 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 8
### Two Translations
Peters believes there will be 2 translations: one before ("the first-fruits") the great tribulation and one after ("the harvest") the great tribulation.
p. 329 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 9

### Why a distinction between "first fruits" and "harvest"
>Obs. 11. The question may be asked, Why such a distinction? The reply is, because such is God’s pleasure in the matter. It is not for us to assert with any degree of positiveness *who* shall thus be favored with a translation, and escape the great tribulation. We can only point out the general affirmation (as e.g. “them that honor me, I will honor,” etc.) upon the subject, and leave each one draw his own conclusions. There is a difference between *mere* salvation and *the special* honor, station, dignity, etc., that God *in addition& may be pleased to bestow upon certain ones. There were other pious ones when Enoch and Elijah were translated, and yet *they only* were favored; and we doubt not that *many* who ultimately will be saved with great glory (because of their faithful witnessing during the last severe trial) will *be left* at this translation.
>p. 332 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 11
### Only the select few who watch and pray always
>... Dr. Seiss, with whom many concur, is undoubtedly correct in saying: “I have no idea that a very large portion of mankind, or even of the professing Church, will be thus taken. The first translation, if I may so speak, will embrace *only the select few* who watch and pray always,” etc.
>p. 332 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 11
### They love "the blessed hope"
>... *one distinguishing characteristic* will be exhibited by all, viz., *that they “love the appearing” of Christ* (2 Tim. 4:8), *that they earnestly desire it, and regard it as the highest possible blessing, “the blessed hope”* (Tit. 2:13).
>p. 332 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 11
### To receive instructions and assignments
>... as Christ comes to make the preliminary arrangements for the setting up of the Theocratic Davidic Kingdom, it is *eminently suitable*, that all the saints down to that period should be gathered in order to receive their instructions, to have their positions, etc., assigned, so that they can act with Him as executors in the Divine administrations that follow. This (Prop. 166) measured by the creatures capacity requires time, and such time will be given to this particular purpose in the place predicted. Hence this distinction grows out of the Divine purpose; which such saints are designed to aid in executing and establishing.
>p. 333 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 11
### Watchful with purity of heart and life
>All who are *watchful* servants, and whom the truth leads *to purity* of heart and life, out of all denomination, shall be thus translated, but they who despise prophecy (Jer. 23:33-36) shall bear their burden.
>p. 333 Vol 2 Prop. 130 Obs. 11 Note
