## I. THE ABRAHAMIC COVENANT
There are 24 observations by Peters in this section.
### The things promised
>The covenant (see good remarks on the meaning of the word “covenant” by Barnes, Notes on Heb. 8:8, and 9:16) made with Abraham is found in Gen. 12:1-3, 7; 13:14-17; 15:4-21; 17:4-16; 22:15-18. 
>
>The things promised by God are the following: 
>1. That Abraham’s name shall be great. 
>2. That a great nation should come from him. 
>3. He should be a blessing so great that in him shall all families of the earth be blessed. 
>4. To him personally (“to thee”) and to his seed should be given Palestine forever to inherit. 
>5. The multitude of his seed should be as the dust of the earth. 
>6. That whoever blessed him should be blessed, and whosoever cursed him should be cursed. 
>7. He should be the father of many nations. 
>8. Kings should proceed from him. 
>9. The covenant shall be perpetual, “an everlasting covenant.” 
>10. The land of Canaan shall be “an everlasting possession.” 
>11. God will be a God to him and to his seed. 
>12. His seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. 
>13. In his seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.

### Belief in resurrection and future life required
>. . . the foundation upon which the Mosaic superstructure rests -- *necessitates a belief in the resurrection and a future life*.
>p. 301 Vol. 1 Prop 49 Obs. 10
### Inheriting the land
>The reader has seen where the line of argument is leading us, viz.: *to our inheriting the land with Abraham and the Christ, being co-heirs, co-inheritors of the same promises*. Indeed, let a concordance be taken, and let the passages be sought out which promise to the saints an inheriting of the land and the earth, and the student will be surprised at their number, unity and richness of expression, forming a *necessary sequence* to this very covenant relationship (comp. Props. 142, 146-152).
>p. 303 Vol. 1 Prop 49 Obs. 12
#### Justin Martyr
>Our faith in this matter is the faith of the Primitive Church, so that we reverently and cordially say with Justin Martyr (*Dial. Trypho* ch. 119), “*along with Abraham we shall inherit the holy land, when we shall receive the inheritance for an endless eternity, being the children of Abraham through the like faith*?” 
>
>NOTE: And in ch. 139 he says: "There shall be a future possession of the saints in  *this same land*. And hence all men everywhere, whether bond or free, who believe in Christ, and recognize *the truth* in His own words and those of his prophets, know that they shall be *with Him in that land*, and inherit incorruptible and everlasting good." He makes a number of such references to the fulfilment of the Abrahamic covenant, making Jesus the promised Seed, with whom believers are co-heirs in the covenanted inheritance.
>p. 304 Vol. 1 Prop 49 Obs. 14 and note
#### Irenaeus
>Indeed, with Irenaeus (Ag. Her., ch. 32), we may add: “It is fitting that the just, rising at the appearing of God, should in the renewed state *receive the promise of inheritance which God covenanted to the Fathers, and should reign in it*;” then following the argument respecting the covenant promises made to Abraham and arguing, as we have done, that Abraham received them not, he continues: “Thus, therefore, as God promised *to him* the inheritance of the earth, and he received *it not* during the whole time he lived in it, *it is necessary that he should receive it*, together with his seed, that is, with such of them as fear God and believe in Him—*in the resurrection of the just*”—and then showing that Christ and the Church are of the true seed and partakers of the same promises, he concludes: “Thus, therefore, those *who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham*; and the same are the children of Abraham. For God repeatedly promised *the inheritance of the land to Abraham and his seed*; and as neither Abraham nor his seed, that is, those who are justified by faith, have enjoyed any inheritance in it, they *will undoubtedly receive it at the resurrection of the just. For true and unchangeable is God*; wherefore also He said: ‘*Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth*.”’ Thus the early Church spoke in *strict accordance with unbounded faith in covenant promise*. The prevailing modern notions, which make the covenants mean something else, were then unknown; for all the churches established East and West, North and South, both Jewish and Gentile, *held to this inheritance* as we now receive it.
>p. 304 Vol. 1 Prop 49 Obs. 14

### Origen's fanciful interpretation
***Origen*** is one of the earliest who "opened the floodgates for fanciful interpretation". In one work he "contends that the land promised to the righteous does not refer to Judea or any portion of the earth. . ."

## II. THE SINAITIC COVENANT, MADE WITH ISRAEL AT MOUNT SINAI
There are 2 observations by Peters in this section

## III. THE DAVIDIC COVENANT
There are 8 observations by Peters in this section

### The passage
>Having already shown and proven (Props. 28, 31, 32) how the Theocratic element was incorporated with the Davidic line, which God (as the chief Ruler and so acknowledged) chose, attention is now called to the distinguishing covenant with David by which this union is made forever inseparable; and by which this union is to be specially manifested in the sight of, and for the blessings of, the world through a descendant of David’s. The covenant is found in 2 Sam, 7:10-16 (1 Chron. 17:11-14), “*The Lord telleth thee that He will make thee a house. And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish His Kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of His Kingdom forever. I will be His Father and He shall be my Son. If he commit iniquity I will chasten Him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men. But my mercy shall not depart away from Him, as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee. And thine house and thy Kingdom shall be established forever before thee; thy throne shall be established forever.*"
>p. 313 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 1

> When we come to this Davidic covenant, this perpetuation of the Theocratic relationship with the house of David, how much we regret the lost books of Samuel, Gad, and Nathan on the life of David.
> p. 313 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 1 Note 2
### Not any descendent, only Christ
>Learned and able men, forsaking the Primitive view and overlooking *the perpetuity* of this covenant, gravely tell us that Solomon and other descendants were here denoted; but we vastly prefer to let God explain His own language and the meaning intended. Thus, e.g. Acts 2:30, “*David being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;*” and Paul, directly quoting this covenant (Heb. 1:5), applies it to Christ Jesus, asking, “*Unto which of the angels said He at any time.” . . . “I will be to Him a Father and He shall be to me a Son*.” The announcing angel (Luke 1:30-33) gives the same testimony that the covenant truly refers to Christ.
>p. 313 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 2
### David's understanding
>How did David himself understand this covenant? This is best stated in his own language. Read e.g. Ps. 72, which describes a Son *infinitely superior* to Solomon; reflect over Ps. 132, and after noticing that “*the Lord hath sworn in truth unto David, He will not turn from it; of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne*” (which Peter, Acts 2:30, 31, *expressly* refers to Jesus); consider the numerous Messianic allusions in this and other Psalms (89th, 110th, 72d, 48th, 45th, 21st, 2d, etc.), so regarded and *explicitly* quoted in the New Test, by inspired men; ponder the fact that David calls Him “*my Lord*,” “*higher than the kings of the earth*,” and gives Him a position, power, dominion, immortality, and perpetuity, that *no mortal King* can possibly attain to, and most certainly we are not wrong in believing that David himself, according to the tenor of the covenant “*thy Kingdom shall be established forever before thee*” expected to be in this Kingdom of his Son and Lord both to witness and experience its blessedness (so Storrs, *Diss. on Kingdom*, and many others).
>p. 314 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 3
### Divine-human
>The Prophets following, had a similar understanding of this divine-human disposition or ordering, by which David’s Son would *personally, through David’s Kingdom*, bestow the blessings of perfected Redemption. Thus e.g. Isa. 9:7, Jer. 23:5, 6, and 30:9, and 33:15-26, etc. (comp. Props. 21, 31, 33, 68, 122, etc.).
>p. 314 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 4

Isaiah 9:7
There will be no end to the increase of _His_ government or of peace,
On the throne of David and over his kingdom,
To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness
From then on and forevermore.
The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will accomplish this.

Jeremiah 23:5,6
5 “Behold, _the_ days are coming,” declares Yahweh,
“When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch;
And He will reign as king and prosper
And do justice and righteousness in the land.
6 In His days Judah will be saved,
And Israel will dwell securely;
And this is His name by which He will be called,
‘Yahweh our righteousness.’

Jeremiah 30:9
But they shall be a slave to Yahweh their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.

Jeremiah 33:15-26
15 In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch of David to branch forth; and He shall do justice and righteousness on the earth. 16 In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell in security; and this is _the name_ by which she will be called: Yahweh is our righteousness.’ 17 For thus says Yahweh, ‘David shall not have a man cut off from sitting on the throne of the house of Israel; 18 and the Levitical priests shall not have a man cut off from before Me who is to offer burnt offerings, to offer up grain offerings in smoke, and to perform sacrifices continually.’” 19 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 20 “Thus says Yahweh, ‘If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night will not be at their appointed time, 21 then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers. 22 As the host of heaven cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.’” 23 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 24 “Have you not seen what this people have spoken, saying, ‘The two families which Yahweh chose, He has rejected them’? Thus they have spurned My people from being a nation any longer in their sight. 25 Thus says Yahweh, ‘If My covenant _for_ day and night _stand_ not, _and_ the statutes for heaven and earth I have not established, 26 then I would reject the seed of Jacob and David My servant, not taking from his seed rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But I will return their fortunes and will have compassion on them.’”
### Language of the covenant
>Before censuring the Jews, as many do, for believing that Jesus would *literally restore* the Davidic throne and Kingdom, we must consider, in fairness, that they *were justified* in so doing by *the very language (Props. 4, 21, and 48) of the covenant*. It is incredible that God should in the most important matters, affecting the interests and the happiness of man and nearly touching His own veracity, clothe them in words, which, *if not true* in their obvious and common sense, *would deceive* the pious and God-fearing of many ages. We cannot, dare not (however upheld by many eminent names) entertain an opinion *so dishonoring both to God and His ancient believing children*. The Jews are abundantly defended in their faith by the covenant itself; the correctness and justness of their fondly entertained hopes appear from the particulars incorporated with it. 
>(1) The words and sentences in their plain grammatical acceptation, do *expressly* teach their belief. This is denied by no one, not even by those who then proceed to spiritualize the language. Therefore already the Jews are excusable in believing what God so definitely declares (comp. Prop. 48).  
>(2) The covenant is distinctively associated with *the Jewish nation* and none other. Passing by the numerous proof texts which will be presented hereafter, let us confine ourselves to the understanding of this relationship by David at the giving of the covenant. In 2 Sam. 7:23, 24 (1 Chron. 17:21, 22) he expresses before God his consciousness of the magnitude of the blessing; that this covenant, in virtue of *his* throne and Kingdom being thus distinguished, embraces “*one nation*” (comp. Props. 24, 59, 60, etc.), and this *the same* nation that was brought out of Egypt (i.e., Abraham’s descendants), who should be established in “thy (God’s) land.” And then ascending to the promise previously given that *this* nation is specially chosen, i.e. the elect nation, and that this very covenant made with himself is a marvellous confirmation of this truth, he adds: “*Thou hast confirmed to Thyself thy people Israel*” (the same nation brought out of Egypt, as the connection snows) *“to be a people unto Thee forever; and Thou, Lord, art become their God.”* With such testimony before them, how could the faithful Jews hesitate in believing as they did respecting their nation, its elect position, its supremacy owing to *this Theocratic exaltation in and through the Messiah*. 
>(3) It is called *a perpetual covenant*, i.e. one that shall endure forever. It may, indeed, require time before its fulfilment; it may even for a time be held, so far as the nation is concerned, in the background, but *it must be ultimately realized*. David himself, in his last words (2 Sam. 23:5), emphatically says: “*He hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure; for this is all my salvation and all my desire*. The prophet Isaiah reiterates (55:3), pronouncing it “*an everlasting covenant, even the sure mercies of David*.” Surely no one can fail to see that this denotes, as Barnes (Com. loci), “*an unchanging and unwavering covenant,—a covenant which was not to be revoked*“, — *one which was not to be abrogated, but which was to be perpetual,* —and that “*God would ratify this covenant*.” Assuredly so;— *why then accuse the Jews of folly in trusting in it?’* 
>(4) It was *confirmed by oath* (Ps. 132:11, and 89:3, 4, 33), thus giving the strongest possible assurance of its ample fulfilment. Could the Jews do less *than trust* in language thus confirmed? (comp. Props. 47 and 48). 
>(5) To leave no doubt whatever, and to render unbelief utterly inexcusable, God concisely and most forcibly presents His determination (Ps. 89:34): *“My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.”* It would have been sheer presumption and blindness in the Jews to have altered (under the plea— modern—of spirituality) the covenant, and to have refused to accept of *the obvious sense* conveyed by the words; and there is *a heavy responsibility* resting upon those, who, even under the most pious intentions, *deliberately alter* the covenant words and attach to them *a foreign* meaning.
>p. 315-316 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 5 reformatted

### Language of the apostles
>The language of the apostles is eminently calculated to confirm the Jewish belief in *the literal fulfilment of the Davidic covenant*. Thus e.g. let any unprejudiced reader take the first sermons that were delivered after the day of Pentecost, addressed to Jews, and he cannot fail to see this feature. Peter (Acts 2:14-36), referring to the covenant promise that *Jesus Christ would sit on David’s throne*, correctly argues that the performance of this requires the resurrection of Jesus, which David also foretold as a prerequisite. He then informs the Jews that He did thus arise, that He ascended to heaven where He is exalted as Lord and Christ, waiting for the time when His foes shall be made His footstool, “whom (Acts 3:12-26) the heaven must receive *until the times of restitution of all things*” (keeping in mind the Jewish idea of restitution as *always associated* with the restored Davidic Kingdom) shall come, and then “He (God) shall send Jesus Christ” through whom this is effected. He exhorts them on the ground that they “*are children of the covenant which God made with our fathers*” to repent that they may become worthy participants in “*the times of refreshing*” (Jewish expression), which “*shall come from the presence of the Lord*.” Let any one read the covenant and prophecies directly bearing on it, and then place himself in the position (Prop. 20) of a Jewish hearer of Peter, with Jewish faith, expectations, and covenant relationship, and the decided impression will be made that the covenant is not altered but remains unchanged, that the death of Jesus combined with resurrection and exaltation only qualities Him the better to meet the conditions of the covenant, and that through this resurrected Jesus, when *the time appointed* by the Father arrives, *this covenant will be verified*.
>p. 317-318 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 6

### Early church view
>This is confirmed by the fully admitted early church view on the subject. Let the reader pause and reflect, *how it comes*, if the prevalent modern notion of the covenant is correct, that the early Christians (who had the advantages of apostolic, inspired teaching, or were close to it) *held to the grammatical sense of the covenant* and fully believed with the Jews that *the Messiah would come* (again, as to Jesus) *to restore the Davidic throne and Kingdom*? Upon what supposition can it be satisfactorily explained, excepting the one that they were *correct*.
>p. 318 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 7
### Order of fulfillment
>Having called attention to the covenant and its literal fulfilment, it may be suitable to present the order of fulfilment as given by David himself. Necessarily brief and abrupt, so as not to conflict with the free agency of man, it is a sublime vindication of David’s inspiration, the perpetuity of the covenant, and its ultimate literal realization.
>p. 318-319 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 8

>Consider Ps. 89, and observe these particulars as stated: 
>(1) David acknowledges the bestowal of the covenant by God, and its confirmation by oath, "I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn unto David My servant, Thy seed will I establish forever, and build up thy throne to all generations" (v. 1-4). 
>(2) He expresses praise that God's wonders and faithfulness will be shown "in the congregation (gathering) of the saints," and that He has the authority, power, and mercy to perform His promises (v. 5 to 18). 
>(3) He again refers to the covenant , shows that One shall be specially exalted, and that God says : "I will make Him My First-born, higher than the kings of the earth.  My mercy will I keep for Him forevermore, and My covenant shall stand fast in Him. His (David's) seed also will I make to endure forever, and His throne as the days of heaven" (v. 19-29). 
>(4) Then as this Kingdom is offered to the regular descendants of David, and it is foreseen that they will become unworthy of it, God foretells the same, with the additional assurance to David that, *notwithstanding* such rebellion and His withdrawal for a time, the covenant will still be fulfilled, in these pregnant words : "If his (David's) children forsake My law and walk not in My judgements, if they break My statutes and keep not My commandments, then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. *Nevertheless*, My lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer My faithfulness to fail.  My covenant will I not break nor alter the thing that is gone out of My lips.  Once have I sworn by My Holiness, that I will not lie unto David.  His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before Me. It shall be established forever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven" (v. 30-37).  Here it is positively asserted that the relapse of the nation and a resultant of the nation and a resultant infliction of punishment (just as centuries have witnessed) shall not change God's promise to David respecting that seed of his that shall reign on his throne.
>(5) Now comes a remarkable transition, which should shame the unbelief of doubting ones, seeing that it is descriptive of the precise condition of things as they exist to-day. David having foretold the *conditional* overthrow of his kingdom, and yet that God will be faithful in its final restoration, now plainly predicts *the downfall itself* : "But Thou hast cast off and abhorred ; Thou hast been wroth with Thine anointed" (i.e. the Theocratic kings that followed David). "Thou hast made void the covenant of Thy servant ; Thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground," etc. "Thou has made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground," etc. The covenant is unrealized; the Theocratic Kingdom is fallen; the very throne and Kingdom, the subject of such special promise, is now overthrown. Then, however, resting upon the assurances given, he asks : "*How long, Lord?* Wilt Thou hide Thyself forever? Shall Thy wrath burn as fire?" "Lord, where are Thy former lovingkindnesses, which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth?" David's faith in God that He would remember His covenant and restore his cast-down crown and throne, is briefly but finely expressed : "Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants." "Blessed be the Lord forevermore. Amen and Amen." Who, that is an humble believer in the Word as written, can, in the face of such predictions, deride the early church faith evolved by them? Who, when observing how carefully every objection is answered lest faith should stumble and fall, can resist the conviction that there is a force in these words, which are yet -- when realized -- destined to, form one of the grandest displays of God's faithfulness and mercy in the Redemptive scheme?
