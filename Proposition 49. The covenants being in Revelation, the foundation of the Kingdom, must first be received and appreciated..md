[[Davidic Covenant]]

## I. THE ABRAHAMIC COVENANT
There are 24 observations by Peters in this section.

>The covenant (see good remarks on the meaning of the word “covenant” by Barnes, Notes on Heb. 8:8, and 9:16) made with Abraham is found in Gen. 12:1-3, 7; 13:14-17; 15:4-21; 17:4-16; 22:15-18. 
>
>The things promised by God are the following: 
>1. That Abraham’s name shall be great. 
>2. That a great nation should come from him. 
>3. He should be a blessing so great that in him shall all families of the earth be blessed. 
>4. To him personally (“to thee”) and to his seed should be given Palestine forever to inherit. 
>5. The multitude of his seed should be as the dust of the earth. 
>6. That whoever blessed him should be blessed, and whosoever cursed him should be cursed. 
>7. He should be the father of many nations. 
>8. Kings should proceed from him. 
>9. The covenant shall be perpetual, “an everlasting covenant.” 
>10. The land of Canaan shall be “an everlasting possession.” 
>11. God will be a God to him and to his seed. 
>12. His seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. 
>13. In his seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.

>. . . the foundation upon which the Mosaic superstructure rests -- *necessitates a belief in the resurrection and a future life*.
>p. 301 Vol. 1 Prop 49 Obs. 10

>The reader has seen where the line of argument is leading us, viz.: *to our inheriting the land with Abraham and the Christ, being co-heirs, co-inheritors of the same promises*. Indeed, let a concordance be taken, and let the passages be sought out which promise to the saints an inheriting of the land and the earth, and the student will be surprised at their number, unity and richness of expression, forming a *necessary sequence* to this very covenant relationship (comp. Props. 142, 146-152).
>p. 303 Vol. 1 Prop 49 Obs. 12

#### Justin Martyr
>Our faith in this matter is the faith of the Primitive Church, so that we reverently and cordially say with Justin Martyr (Dial. Trypho ch. 119), “along with Abraham we shall inherit the holy land, when we shall receive the inheritance for an endless eternity, being the children of Abraham through the like faith?” 
>\** And in ch. 139 he says: "There shall be a future possession of the saints in  *this same land*. And hence all men everywhere, whether bond or free, who believe in Christ, and recognize *the truth* in His own words and those of his prophets, know that they shall be *with Him in that land*, and inherit incorruptible and everlasting good." He makes a number of such references to the fulfilment of the Abrahamic covenant, making Jesus the promised Seed, with whom believers are co-heirs in the covenanted inheritance.
>p. 304 Vol. 1 Prop 49 Obs. 14

#### Irenaeus
>Indeed, with Irenaeus (Ag. Her., ch. 32), we may add: “It is fitting that the just, rising at the appearing of God, should in the renewed state receive the promise of inheritance which God covenanted to the Fathers, and should reign in it;” then following the argument respecting the covenant promises made to Abraham and arguing, as we have done, that Abraham received them not, he continues: “Thus, therefore, as God promised to him the inheritance of the earth, and he received it not during the whole time he lived in it, it is necessary that he should receive it, together with his seed, that is, with such of them as fear God and believe in Him—in the resurrection of the just”—and then showing that Christ and the Church are of the true seed and partakers of the same promises, he concludes: “Thus, therefore, those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham; and the same are the children of Abraham. For God repeatedly promised the inheritance of the land to Abraham and his seed; and as neither Abraham nor his seed, that is, those who are justified by faith, have enjoyed any inheritance in it, they will undoubtedly receive it at the resurrection of the just. For true and unchangeable is God; wherefore also He said: ‘Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”’ Thus the early Church spoke in strict accordance with unbounded faith in covenant promise. The prevailing modern notions, which make the covenants mean something else, were then unknown; for all the churches established East and West, North and South, both Jewish and Gentile, held to this inheritance as we now receive it.

***Origen*** is one of the earliest who "opened the floodgates for fanciful interpretation". In one work he "contends that the land promised to the righteous does not refer to Judea or any portion of the earth. . ."

## II. THE SINAITIC COVENANT, MADE WITH ISRAEL AT MOUNT SINAI
There are 2 observations by Peters in this section

## III. THE DAVIDIC COVENANT
There are 8 observations by Peters in this section

>Having already shown and proven (Props. 28, 31, 32) how the Theocratic element was incorporated with the Davidic line, which God (as the chief Ruler and so acknowledged) chose, attention is now called to the distinguishing covenant with David by which this union is made forever inseparable; and by which this union is to be specially manifested in the sight of, and for the blessings of, the world through a descendant of David’s. The covenant is found in 2 Sam, 7:10-16 (1 Chron. 17:11-14), “*The Lord telleth thee that He will make thee a house. And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish His Kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of His Kingdom forever. I will be His Father and He shall be my Son. If he commit iniquity I will chasten Him with the rod of men and with the strives of the children of men.’ But my mercy shall not depart away from Him, as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee. And thine house and thy Kingdom shall be established forever before thee; thy throne shall be established forever.*"
>p. 313 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 1

> When we come to this Davidic covenant, this perpetuation of the Theocratic relationship with the house of David, how much we regret the lost books of Samuel, Gad, and Nathan on the life of David.
> p. 313 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 1 Note 2

>Learned and able men, forsaking the Primitive view and overlooking *the perpetuity* of this covenant, gravely tell us that Solomon and other descendants were here denoted; but we vastly prefer to let God explain His own language and the meaning intended. Thus, e.g. Acts 2:30, “*David being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;*” and Paul, directly quoting this covenant (Heb. 1:5), applies it to Christ Jesus, asking, “*Unto which of the angels said He at any time.” . . . “I will be to Him a Father and He shall be to me a Son*.” The announcing angel (Luke 1:30-33) gives the same testimony that the covenant truly refers to Christ.
>p. 313 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 2

>How did David himself understand this covenant? This is best stated in his own language. Read e.g. Ps. 72, which describes a Son *infinitely superior* to Solomon; reflect over Ps. 132, and after noticing that “*the Lord hath sworn in truth unto David, He will not turn from it; of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne*” (which Peter, Acts 2:30, 31, *expressly* refers to Jesus); consider the numerous Messianic allusions in this and other Psalms (89th, 110th, 72d, 48th, 45th, 21st, 2d, etc.), so regarded and *explicitly* quoted in the New Test, by inspired men; ponder the fact that David calls Him “*my Lord*,” “*higher than the kings of the earth*,” and gives Him a position, power, dominion, immortality, and perpetuity, that *no mortal King* can possibly attain to, and most certainly we are not wrong in believing that David himself, according to the tenor of the covenant “*thy Kingdom shall be established forever before thee*” expected to be in this Kingdom of his Son and Lord both to witness and experience its blessedness (so Storrs, *Diss. on Kingdom*, and many others).
>p. 314 Vol. 1 Prop. 49 Obs. 3

>The Prophets following, had a similar understanding of this divine-human disposition or ordering, by which David’s Son would *personally, through David’s Kingdom*, bestow the blessings of perfected Redemption. Thus e.g. Isa. 9:7, Jer. 23:5, 6, and 30:9, and 33:15-26, etc. (comp. Props. 21, 31, 33, 68, 122, etc.).

Isaiah 9:7
There will be no end to the increase of _His_ government or of peace,
On the throne of David and over his kingdom,
To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness
From then on and forevermore.
The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will accomplish this.

Jeremiah 23:5,6
5 “Behold, _the_ days are coming,” declares Yahweh,
“When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch;
And He will reign as king and prosper
And do justice and righteousness in the land.
6 In His days Judah will be saved,
And Israel will dwell securely;
And this is His name by which He will be called,
‘Yahweh our righteousness.’

Jeremiah 30:9
But they shall be a slave to Yahweh their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.

Jeremiah 33:15-26
15 In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch of David to branch forth; and He shall do justice and righteousness on the earth. 16 In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell in security; and this is _the name_ by which she will be called: Yahweh is our righteousness.’ 17 For thus says Yahweh, ‘David shall not have a man cut off from sitting on the throne of the house of Israel; 18 and the Levitical priests shall not have a man cut off from before Me who is to offer burnt offerings, to offer up grain offerings in smoke, and to perform sacrifices continually.’” 19 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 20 “Thus says Yahweh, ‘If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night will not be at their appointed time, 21 then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers. 22 As the host of heaven cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.’” 23 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 24 “Have you not seen what this people have spoken, saying, ‘The two families which Yahweh chose, He has rejected them’? Thus they have spurned My people from being a nation any longer in their sight. 25 Thus says Yahweh, ‘If My covenant _for_ day and night _stand_ not, _and_ the statutes for heaven and earth I have not established, 26 then I would reject the seed of Jacob and David My servant, not taking from his seed rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But I will return their fortunes and will have compassion on them.’”
