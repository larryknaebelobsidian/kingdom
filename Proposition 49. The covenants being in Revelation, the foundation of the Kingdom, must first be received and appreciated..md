## III. THE DAVIDIC COVENANT
There are 8 observations in this section

>Having already shown and proven (Props. 28, 31, 32) how the Theocratic element was incorporated with the Davidic line, which God (as the chief Ruler and so acknowledged) chose, attention is now called to the distinguishing covenant with David by which this union is made forever inseparable; and by which this union is to be specially manifested in the sight of, and for the blessings of, the world through a descendant of David’s. The covenant is found in 2 Sam, 7:10-16 (1 Chron. 17:11-14), “*The Lord telleth thee that He will make thee a house. And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish His Kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of His Kingdom forever. I will be His Father and He shall be my Son. If he commit iniquity I will chasten Him with the rod of men and with the strives of the children of men.’ But my mercy shall not depart away from Him, as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee. And thine house and thy Kingdom shall be established forever before thee; thy throne shall be established forever.*"
