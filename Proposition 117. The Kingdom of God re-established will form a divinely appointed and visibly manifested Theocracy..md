### God's perfect government - fully consummated
>Obs. 1. This is a Theocracy in deed and in truth, for in this reorganized Kingdom we find the Theocratic idea—God’s idea of a perfect government —fully consummated.
### Fulfills all the details of the prophets
>Obs. 2. The restoration of the Jewish nation, the supremacy of the nation, the reign of the Messiah as David’s Son in connection with it, in brief, all the details given by the prophets of this era, are only reconcilable and in harmony with a re-establishment of the Theocratic government. This insures divinity and visibility.
### Global empire
>Obs. 3. As already intimated, the highest possible position that we can place the Kingdom of God in, is that of regarding it such a Theocratic State or Empire, universal over the earth, founded, governed and developed under Divine authority personally manifested.
### Inconsistency of some able writers 
>Obs. 4. The inconsistency of some able writers on the subject of a Theocracy is remarkable.
### Conceded by many
>Obs. 5. Surely no one should object to this consistent Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom, so precious to the pious Jews and early Church, when many, who reject Millenarian views, still are forced by the peculiarity of predictions to concede that there will be a Theocratic reign, a union of Church and State, a universal, visible, external government.
### If not, then God has failed
>Obs. 6. If such a Theocratic Kingdom, as God Himself instituted, is not permanently and gloriously re-established here upon earth, then it follows that God’s efforts at the establishment of government and the interest which He manifests in it are fruitless of abiding results. Or, in other words, His own Kingdom has proven a failure.

>otherwise it will be said that the Almighty undertook a work which, owing to man, He could not accomplish.
>Obs. 6

>If the original Theocratic idea is lost, if God Himself is not at some period of the world’s history to be its actual, earthly Sovereign, then certainly the earth will lack in its history the completion of a form of government endorsed and adopted as the most desirable by the Omniscient Himself.
>Obs. 6

>The glory of God, in virtue of His beginning, is deeply concerned in the completion of His own system of government; and we may rest assured, from a multitude of concurrent predictions, that He will sanctify Himself in this particular, exalting in the eyes of all people the identical form, now the scoff of unbelievers and even so difficult of acceptance by many believers (comp. Prop. 201).
>Obs. 6
### Delay is no reason for unbelief
>Obs. 7. The delay in this Theocracy is no reason for refusing credence to it, seeing that God so plainly foretells the reason for its delay, viz., in punishment of the nation with which it is connected; and seeing that He also reveals to us a long period of Gentile dominion during which it cannot exist.

>God’s ways are marvellous in preparing for His own government, overruling the freedom of man and his bias for sin, and constantly, slowly but surely, advancing toward His intended goal.
### Eulogistic phraseology of prophets is well deserved
>Obs. 8. The eulogistic phraseology of the prophets which some critics ascribe to Oriental usage, respecting this Theocracy is well deserved. For, if we consider the King, David’s immortal Son, with the Divine inseparable with Him; the redeemed saints, also immortal, inheriting with Christ, and qualified by their trial, experience, etc., to act as rulers with Him; the Jewish nation restored to favor, and its coveted position after an education that never will be lost; the Gentile nations receiving the blessings accruing from a government which ever has been the need of the world; the glorious results ever flowing in free and abundant streams from God’s own fountain of order—all this ought to lead us to feel that language is too feeble to express what will be realized.
### Realizes the darling wish of mighty monarchs
>Obs. 9. This Theocracy will realize the idea of universal Empire, the darling wish of mighty monarchs.
### Creates blessings
>Obs. 10. This Theocracy, as frequently intimated and implied, is designed to create blessings.

>its main object is to procure blessings. It is not to gratify the ambition of the Jewish nation that it enjoys such supremacy, but that, as Paul in Rom. 11; Zech. 8:13, etc., it may dispense richness to others; it is not to gratify pride that saints reign with Christ, but that they may be instrumental in promoting the welfare of others, etc. Of David’s Son itself it is said that His reign shall bring showers of blessing upon all, so that all families of the earth shall be blessed in Him.
>Obs. 10
### Includes salvation of others and redemption of the race
>Obs. 11. This Theocracy embraces not only perfected salvation as in the Rulers, i.e. those who reign with Jesus Christ, who are crowned as the inheritors of the Kingdom, but it includes the contemplated salvation of others, and the redemption of the race as a race.

>This Kingdom thus introduced is the bulwark erected by God against the enemies of God, by which they are either overthrown, destroyed or brought into subjection; by which all evil shall be rooted out, and the race itself be perpetuated in a state of purity and happiness just as predicted. It is the Divine means by which all are brought to feel and recognize the relations sustained to a Creator, Preserver, Redeemer, and Benefactor; removing all causes of war, national jealousies, civil disturbances, diversity of church government and worship, and bestowing peace, rejoicing and happiness.
>Obs. 11
### Consider the associated rulers
>Obs. 12. The reader’s attention is briefly called to consider, what, in such a Theocratic arrangement, must be the honor and dignity of the Rulers associated with the Mighty Son of Man. The position of the twelve apostles ruling over the twelve tribes, and that of the saints in their various stations of kingship and priesthood, all linked with the glory of this Kingdom. (See Props. 154, 156.)
### Reserved for God's people that are in a covenanted theocratic relationship with Jesus
>Obs. 13. How vain is the boast of statesman or king, that this or that nation and land will become the greatest that earth shall ever behold. If wise, they would see that this is reserved for the now despised people that stand in covenanted Theocratic relationship with Jesus.
### How Christ shall be recognized
>The Bible, in addition to the pleas presented by us, points to the time coming when Christ shall be openly and visibly recognized 
>1. as the glorious One, who, 
>2. as the Second Adam, having substituted Himself through love, is the efficacious Head of Humanity in its newly begun destiny; who,
>3. as Redeemer, having offered expiation to and honored the justice of God, now practically manifests the fruits of salvation; who, 
>4. as Prophet, having taught restitution, now exhibits Himself as the Truth evidenced by the work performed before Him; who, 
>5. as Priest, having made an acceptable sacrifice, now presents before the world the fruit resulting from it; who, 
>6. as King, in virtue even of His Divine union and showing it by guidance, supporting, etc., now manifests it in the special ordained manner 
>7. as Sovereign Ruler.
