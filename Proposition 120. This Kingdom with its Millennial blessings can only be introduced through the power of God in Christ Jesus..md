# Proposition 120. This Kingdom with its Millennial blessings can only be introduced through the power of God in Christ Jesus.

### Props Mentioned
144 175 
### Christ is the introducer of the Millennial era
>Obs. 1. That Christ is *the Introducer* of the Millennial era is so abundantly asserted by the Prophets that a large number of writers, opposed to our view, still admit that Christ must come at this period spiritually in extraordinary power.
>p. 152 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 1
### Kingdom not introduced by present existing instrumentalities
>Obs. 2. The multitude of writers, who so persistently proclaim that the Kingdom and Millennial blessedness shall be introduced by present existing instrumentalities, are in *direct* opposition to Scripture.
>p. 153 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 2
### Sad opposition can be tested
>Obs. 3. It is saddening to find how far this denial of the necessity of Christ’s Second Coming *for purposes of Salvation* is carried in our Theological literature. Men who would shrink from any impeachment of orthodoxy, or denial of truth, array themselves against Covenant promise under the misguiding influence of supposed developed truth.
>...
>Thus to illustrate: In the excellent *Quarterly Review* for Jan., 1874, in a one-sided Art., which totally ignores *the expressed* views of the confessors, the following bold assertion is made: “Christ’s power to bless and save His people and protect them against the devil and sin is *not in His Coming again on earth*, but in His session at the right hand of God and His power there in their behalf,” etc. How such language can be employed in the face of scriptural authority, is a matter of surprise. The reader can readily test the trustworthiness of the declaration by referring to these facts: 
>(1) that His Coming is *for Salvation, to complete Redemption*, Heb. 9:28; Luke 21:27, 28; Rom. 8:19-23; Eph. 4:30, etc.; 
>(2) *to raise* the dead, 1 Thess. 4:14, 16, etc.; 
>(3) *to change* the living, 1 Cor. 15:42-44, 51-54, etc.; 
>(4) *to invest* with dominion (Prop. 154); 
>(5) *to remove* the wicked, His enemies, 2 Thess. 2:8-11, etc.; 
>(6) *to deliver* the Jewish nation (Prop. Ill, etc.); 
>(7) *to relieve* creation, Rom. 8:19-21, etc.; 
>(8) in brief, to introduce the *numerous blessings* which our argument evolves.
>It is certainly sufficient, in order to prevent our accepting such contradictory utterances, to know that He comes for Salvation; and that that Coming is represented to be the most efficacious in removing sin and overcoming Satan.
>p. 154 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 3
### The blessed hope
>Obs. 4. On the other hand, it is refreshing to see even some of our most unrelenting opponents acknowledge the force of Scripture representation to the extent that they also make the Sec. Advent the most desirable object of hope, ascribing to it, as the Spirit does, divine purposes of Salvation.
>...
>Christ’s Sec. Coming is “*the blessed hope*” of the Church—that it is “*the polar star*” of faith—...
>p. 155 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 4
### Savior's even seen in other religions
>Obs. 5. It is objected by unbelievers that the notion that some great Saviour is to come to restore all things, is found in other religions beside the Christian.
>... in the system of Zoroaster mention is made of a future Restorer or Saviour, who is expected to come at the end of the age, restore the dead by a resurrection, and introduce a Kingdom of untroubled happiness, etc.
>... it evidences, what was observed previously, that man feels *the utter inability* of existing causes to produce such a restitution, and therefore, owing to the inadequacy of present means and instrumentalities, falls back upon *the supernatural*. This feeling, as we have seen, is general, and naturally arises from reflection, and a desire to secure deliverance.
>p. 155-156 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 5
### Removal of the curse requires higher power
>Obs. 6. The most intelligent and profound thinkers of every age declare, that the removal of the self-evident curse (explain its introduction as they may) entailed upon the earth and its inhabitants, demands *higher power and greater manifestations of Deity* than now are exhibited.
>...
>The scope of the Word asserts, that man is under the curse through his fallen condition, and that the evils arising therefrom are the work of Satan.
>...
>The Bible points to *One alone* who is to produce this change, viz., to “*the Christ*” who is revealed expressly “*to destroy the works of the devil*."
>p. 156 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 6
### First Adam caused the curse, second Adam removes it
>Obs. 7. The Bible attributes the curse, or introduction of evil, to the fall of *the first Adam*, and the removal of it to *the second Adam*, that is “the Christ.”
>p. 157 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 7

>The record itself does *not* say that no evil previously existed in the earth, but positively asserts that evil did exist in Satan; and it was by this evil *already* present, and which came in contact with man, that the Fall was induced. Death itself was in existence, seeing that it is implied by the bestowal of *the tree of life* in Eden *by which* immortality could be obtained.
>p. 158 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 7

>*Being mortal*, he fell under the penalty of a law of death *then* in existence, and which he might have avoided by obedience; and when the Bible says that death came by man and passed upon all men, it simply refers us to the plain fact that *immortality*, in the tree of life, *was tendered* to man, and he rendering himself *unfit* for its reception, fell under the power of death, and with him, of course, all his descendants. The Bible and science here accord, for Eden was not the whole earth, but only a limited space, specially fitted for man; for evil was here present before man came; the simple *withdrawal* of the tree of life exhibited the *already existing* laws of mortality; the curse itself was (1) a removal from an Eden state, (2) the sad experience and confirmation of evil into which man was driven outside of Eden.
>p. 158 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 7

>... the Bible language is so guarded, that it is also correct to insist as it does, that through the fall of Adam the race was placed under the curse, inasmuch as Adam *entailed* his fallen condition upon all his offspring; for, as intimated, immortality being withdrawn from fallen man, as too dangerous and exalted to be allowed, Adam and his descendants must obtain it *now* in some other way, viz., through the power of a Redeemer, while they all suffer the loss of Eden.
>p. 158 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 7

>If the Bible had asserted that all the earth was an Eden, and that no evil and death had any previous existence, then science might find some leverage for its objection, but depending on opinions of men engrafted on the Word, it becomes futile and very unscientific.
>p. 159 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 7
### Restoration to Eden state
>Obs. 8. This leads us to consider that a restoration to an Eden state involves the reproduction of an Eden immensely greater than the original.
>...
>And not only so, but in the new creative energy manifested at this period, there are intimations which seem to point to an enlargement of the earth itself.
>...
>Therefore, we rest satisfied that the Eden *will be fully commensurate* to the number who shall be entitled to admission to it.
>p. 159 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 8
### Exhibition of the love of God
>Obs. 9. This Kingdom designed to carry out and display the Redemptive process in its realization will exhibit in the highest degree *the love* of God through re-creative power and activity. No one doubts but that such love was strongly shown in creation, in the Incarnation, in Providential movements, etc., but all these, if we are to credit the Prophets, are only forerunners of *a higher manifestation* of His goodness when the consummation arrives.
>p. 159 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 9
### Early church believed the advent of Christ brought deliverance
>Obs. 10. May we not again remind the reader, how logically consistent the early Church was to attribute *to Christ at His Sec. Advent this work* of restoring all things through the power of His rule and Kingdom?
>...
>neither Paul nor the other Apostles believed in a conversion of the world, but rather in its growing worse until the personal Advent of Christ brought deliverance.
>p. 160 Vol. 2 Prop. 120 Obs. 10
