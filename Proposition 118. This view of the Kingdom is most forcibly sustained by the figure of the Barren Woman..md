>Who is this “*barren woman*”? The definite answer is given by the entire scope and order of the prediction. For the present, we reply: It is the Jewish nation as the covenanted elect nation, or, if the reader chooses, Jerusalem as the type of the nation, its chief representative, the nation itself being thus designated.

>For, 
>
>(1) This nation is represented as *married* to God, being His wife. The marriage relation being thus used as a figure to denote *the intimate, Theocratic relation that God sustained as earthly Head or Ruler over it*. Many passages teach this, in which the nation, under the same figure, is declared to be treacherous as a wife, guilty of whoredoms, etc. In this same chapter she is therefore called “*a wife of youth*,” a woman that was married when but young, etc. Compare Ezek. 16; Jer. 3:20, etc. 
>
>(2) She is a “*barren woman*.” Because, 
>(a) she forsook the Lord and followed her own devices, so that God said, Hos. 2:4,“*And I will not have mercy on her children, for they be the children of whoredoms*;” Hos. 4:6, 
>(b) she persecuted and destroyed her children; Ezek. 16:20,21, “*Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and daughters whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, that thou hast slain my children*,” etc.; 
>(c) hence the increase that would have resulted had she proven faithful, was, owing to her wickedness, not realized, Hos. 9:14-17; 
>(d) by her sinfulness she defeated the gracious purposes of God respecting her. This is apparent from numerous declarations in which God promises to her to perform such and such things if she only prove faithful. The lamentation of Jesus over her is sufficient evidence. The nation, persistent in its evil course, instead of blessings receives the curse which is productive of barrenness; 
>(e) she brings forth fruit unto herself and not of God, Hos. 10:1, “begotten *strange children*” Hos. 5:7. 
>
>(3) She is not only a “*barren*” but “*a desolate woman*.” In view of the wickedness of the nation God forsook her and in wrath hid His face from her (vs. 7, 8), so that in verse 6 she is called “a woman forsaken;” and, owing to this forsaken condition, in verse ‘it is designated by way of reproach a “*widowhood*” (a condition, notwithstanding the assertions of some, that can never be applied to the Church). How amply this has been fulfilled is evident from Scripture (Ezek. 16:36, etc., Hos. 2, etc.), and from history. Down to the present day she is yet in her “*widowhood*” yet “*a woman forsaken*” yet “*judged as a woman that breaketh wedlock*.” Right here the reader may pause and ask, if all this has been *so minutely fulfilled* that it is a matter of record in the languages of the earth, *will not the remainder*, also asserted of this very “forsaken woman,” *be verified*? Certainly!

>Who is this “*married wife*” that is contrasted with the other?
>. . .
>If we open the Bible and read *what follows* the rejection of the Jewish nation and its miserable fall, we find that God *during this period of abandonment* proceeds to raise up *a seed* unto Abraham of those, out of all nations, who fear and obey God. (See Prop, on election and continued election.) It is this seed, this nation thus gathered to whom the Kingdom in a high, *special sense* is to be given—i.e. they also will *be married*, i.e., *enter into this Theocratical relationship with God*. This seed is said in the New Test, in its aggregate (not before) to form “*the chaste virgin*” “*the Bride*” that is to be married *just previous* to the ushering in of the Millennial age at the Sec. Advent of Christ, 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:27; Rev. 19:7, 9. This too, of course, as intimated in the text, and as necessarily included in our argument, occurs *here on earth previous* to the restoration of the Jews.

Larry is not sure of the accuracy of Peter's above conclusions about the "married wife/woman".  The "married woman" is a linguistic contrast used to emphasize the condition of the "barren woman".  Any attempt to try to identify the married woman seems to take the use of the language too far.
