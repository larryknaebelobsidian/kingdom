# Proposition 7. The kingdom being a manifestation of the supernatural, miracles are connected with it.

>Miracles are not to be regarded simply as evidences of the truth —this it indeed subserves—but as *necessary parts* of revelation itself, evincing with a fulness, stronger than language can impress, that the supernatural is indispensable for the establishment of the kingdom, and that it will be exerted in miraculous power whenever required.
>p. 88 Vol. 1 Prop. 7
### Assurances that the kingdom will come as predicted
> The miracles then are *assurances* vouchsafed that the kingdom will come as it is predicted.
>  p. 89 Vol. 1 Prop. 7 Obs. 1

1. Casting out demons
2. Transfiguration
3. Resurrection of dead ones (daughter of Jairus, widow's son, Lazarus)
4. Healing of diseases, blindness, lameness, deafness, dumbness
5. Feeding of the thousands
6. Tempest stilled
7. Ship instantly at its destination
8. Walking on the sea
9. Fish with money inside
10. Barren fig tree destroyed
11. Water into wine
12. His own resurrection and ascension


>Obs. 2. The number and variety of definitions given to miracles indicate the limited nature of human knowledge; we are not greatly concerned in the adoption of any one specially, seeing that from our standpoint we could accept of nearly all, even of some of those given by infidels.
>p. 91-92 Vol. 1 Prop. 7 Obs. 2
### Earnests of power
> Miracles are necessary to a revelation pertaining to the kingdom, a kingdom which is to be set up by an astounding miraculous display.  They become parts, *essential parts* of the revelation, exhibiting *the earnests of power* that is ultimately to accomplish it.
> p. 97 Vol. 1 Prop. 7 Obs. 3

### Miracle-working Saviour
>The Scriptures can never, never be fulfilled without miracle; the earth can never, never be freed from its curse without miracle; man can never, never be delivered without miracle; and, therefore, the Redeemer in whom we trust for redemption is, as *history to-day attests* in the minute and wondrous fulfilment of His miraculous words, *a miracle-working Saviour*.
