# Proposition 40. The hearers of John believed that he preached to them the Kingdom predicted by the Prophets, and in the sense held by themselves.

### Props Mentioned
19 20 21 22 23 24 29 35 

>Obs. 1. The Jewish belief in a *restored* Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom has been noticed (Prop. 20), as supported by the grammatical sense of the prophecies (Prop. 21), and the election of the nation (Prop. 24,) etc. The preaching of John, giving *no* explanation of the Kingdom, indicative that the Kingdom is something well known (Prop. 19), and the employment of current phraseology without change of meaning (Props. 22 and 23), etc.— all proves *the correctness* of our position.
>p. 260 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 1
### Grammatical sense was the only one then used re. the kingdom
>Obs. 2. The grammatical sense was the *only one* then used in relation to the Kingdom, producing unity of belief in a *restored* Davidic Kingdom.
>p. 260 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 2
### No disputes with John the Baptist concerning the kingdom
>Obs. 3. The unity of belief in the same restored Kingdom is evidenced by John’s preaching of the Kingdom raising up *no disputation* concerning it.
>p. 260 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 3
### No antagonism of belief between preacher and hearer
>Obs. 4. The exclusiveness (Prop. 29) of the Jewish nation, the prophecies describing but one Kingdom (Prop. 35), etc., forbid the idea that there was *an antagonism* of belief between the preacher and the hearer. There might be a difference of opinion respecting the imposed condition of repentance, but there could be none concerning the Kingdom so far as related to its essential nature.
>p. 260 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 4
### Brevity of mention assumes understanding
>Obs. 5. This fact of *a unison of view* respecting the Kingdom alone satisfactorily accounts for the exceeding brevity with which it is mentioned.
>p. 260 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 5
### So little detail in the New Testament
>The unity of agreement also accounts for so little descriptive of the Kingdom being given in detail in the New Test. It was fully known and described in the prophets; now to have entered into a detailed statement and particularized *the restored Davidic Kingdom*, would *unnecessarily* have excited the open hostility of the jealous and persecuting Roman Empire.
>p. 260 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 6
### Preaching in the wilderness to use caution
>This unity of agreement is also seen in John doing his preaching in the wilderness—that is, east from Jerusalem in the open country, away from the large cities. He and his hearers, both believing in *a restored Davidic Kingdom*, and he endeavoring by repentance to prepare the nation for its coming, those large gatherings of Jews and the preaching of such a Kingdom would necessarily have excited inquiry and the pressure of Roman power. Hence (especially in view of the foreseen rejection) *the utmost caution*, consistent with John’s mission, is observed. 
>p. 261 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 7
>
>If the modern prevailing view of the Kingdom is the correct one, no reason can be assigned for John’s avoidance of the centres of influence, as e.g. Jerusalem.
>p. 261 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 7 note

### John's disciples agreed
>Obs. 8. The agreement of opinion is seen in the disciples of John, who, as far as known, held to the coming of the restored Davidic Kingdom under the Messiah.
>p. 261 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 8
### Apostles agreed
>Obs. 9. John and his hearers certainly had no other views than those entertained by following preachers of the Kingdom, as e.g. the apostles; see Acts 1:6.
>p. 261 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 9
### Many of our opponents agree
>Obs. 10. The agreement of opinion is frankly admitted by many of our opponents, whom we have quoted, and whom we shall hereafter quote, as e.g. Knapp (Ch. Theol.), Neander (*Life of Christ*, etc.), and others.
>p. 261 Vol. 1 Prop. 40 Obs. 10
