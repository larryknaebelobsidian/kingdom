>This is so *distinctly taught* by Isaiah (chs. 65 and 66), by the pious Jews and Early Church, by a long line of eminent divines, including even our opponents who locate the Kingdom of God in it, and by the magnificent closing (Rev. 21) of Revelation, that it demands no special proof.
>p. 499 Vol. 2 Prop. 148
### "New" also means renewal or restoration
>The word “new,” as has often been noticed, even by opposers, does not necessarily mean something entirely new, but denotes “a renewal or restoration” of something previously existing. It properly, then, denotes the renewal or restoration, with increased glory, of that “heaven and earth” which once existed in its initiatory form (and the entire phrase—as the ancient believers logically held—includes the Messianic Kingdom.
>Obs. 1

>How deeply this ancient belief was still held, even down to the Council of Nice, is seen in Gelasius (Hist. Acts Council), when he refers as proof to Dan. 7:18; Ps. 27:13; Matt 5:5 and Isa. 26:6 for the expression of faith: “We expect new heavens and a new earth, according to the Holy Scriptures, at the appearing of the Great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ”
>Obs. 1
### Not entirely material and not entirely spiritual
>Obs. 2. The creation of “the new heavens and new earth,” in Isa. 65:17 and 66:22, are intimately connected with, and indeed explained by, the unexampled prosperity and joyfulness of Jerusalem, and in the removal of the curse entailing weeping, etc.

>The Kingdom is designed as an instrumentality to restore man and the earth to the forfeited position, and must, if successful, embrace both in its redemptive purpose, just as the Jews held. Hence it is wrong, as some do, to regard this phraseology as exclusively applicable to a material change, and it is likewise erroneous, as others hold, to confine it entirely to spiritual
>Obs. 2
### Figurative meaning per Peters is primary
>Insisting, therefore, that the figurative meaning, which applies this to the Kingdom itself, is the primary one, we, at the same time, do not discard the notion that in this new heavens and new earth are embraced material, radical changes which brings the earth back to its Edenic state.
>Obs. 2
### Incorrect spiritualization 
>Obs. 3. One of the most eminent spiritualizes of the Word (Barnes) tells us: “There shall be, as it were, new heavens and a new earth, in a spiritual sense, at the end of the world.
>...
>This is a gross violation of prophecy, and a most arbitrary application of promises to the present Church. Isa. 65:17,18 and 66:22 are quoted as now realized, which is positively forbidden by the tenor of the predictions (still unrealized) and by Peter, an apostle, expressly locating (2 Pet. 3) their fulfilment in the future.

### Criticisms addressed

### Early church view
>Obs. 5. It would be interesting to trace how the early Church linked the new heavens and new earth with the one thousand years, quoting Ira. 65:17, etc., as e.g. Justin (Dial, with Typho.; see Ch. 3, Brookes El. of Proph. Interp. and writings of Taylor, Mede, Seiss, etc., for references to various of the Fathers), and how it advocated the Kingdom of Jesus Christ as witnessed in, and through, that period, and as being embraced in the heaven and earth.
>...
>at this future time and as part of the heavens and earth the Kingdom of the Messiah is, as the primitive Church held, set up and manifested.
>...
>“With the Lord’s Advent begins the real reign of God upon earthy a Kingdom of righteousness, holiness, and peace, consisting of mortals, but with exemption from the Evil One and his enticements, and under a mighty influence of celestial power,”

>Dr. Tholuck has been noticed by Taylor, Seiss, etc., as saying: “The idea that the perfected Kingdom of Christ is to be transferred to heaven is a modern notion. According to Paul, and the Rev. of John, the Kingdom of God is placed upon the earth, in so far as the earth has part in the universal transformation. This exposition has been adopted and defended by most of the oldest commentators: e.g. Chrysostom, Theodoret, Augustine, Luther, Knox, and others.”
