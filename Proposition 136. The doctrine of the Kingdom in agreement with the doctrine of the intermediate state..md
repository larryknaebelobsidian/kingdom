>. . . the Scripture statements clearly and unmistakably teach a *detention* of the saints from the promised inheritance and reward.
>p. 394 Vol. 2 Prop. 136

Exalting the intermediate state unduly depreciates the Second Advent as "The Blessed Hope"

>The prominence heaped upon the condition of saints after death (so different from the Scriptural position, which says so little respecting it), and the extravagant eulogies attached to it, are practically leading multitudes to make little or nothing of the Advent, the resurrection, the covenant, and the prophecies.
>p. 394 Vol. 2 Prop. 136 Obs. 1

### Imperfect and waiting condition of the saints

>The saints after death are represented as hoping and waiting for greater blessings (Rev. 6:9, 10, 11, comp, with 20:4-6), and it is in view of this that the apostles, when comforting the bereaved, do not dwell on the intermediate state, but refer such for consolation to the period when Redemption is completed, as e.g. 1 Thess. 4:13-18.
>p. 397 Vol. 2 Prop. 136 Obs. 3

>And it is because of this still imperfect and waiting nature of the period between death and the Advent, that the apostles, in the midst of trials and sufferings, overleap the intermediate, and exhort to patience *unto the Coming of the Lord*, e.g. James 5:7.
>p. 397 Vol. 2 Prop. 136 Obs. 3


>and so long as “*the redemption of the body*” Rom. 8:23, is not experienced, an imperfect state must exist.
>p. 397 Vol. 2 Prop. 136 Obs. 4


>Every writer on the subject of the intermediate state confesses that no attempt is made in any place whatever to describe it.
>. . .
>the admission is fully made by writers of all classes (who hold to a future personal Sec. Advent), that the eye of faith and the heart of hope is fixed, *not so much* on the condition after death *as to the condition after the Advent*.
>p. 397 Vol. 2 Prop. 136 Obs. 5

>The key lies in this simple fact, viz., that the intermediate state (whatever it may be) *has no relationship whatever to the fulfilment of covenant and prophecy pertaining to Redemption*, and consequently is not portrayed.
>p. 397-398 Vol. 2 Prop. 136 Obs. 5

>The Early Church doctrine, established under the direct auspices of the apostles, apostles, and the elders appointed by them, was, over against Gnosticism and other errors, *universally* held as follows: that the hope of the believer was in the Sec. Advent (expected speedy), at which period *the inheriting* of the Kingdom, *the crowning and rewarding* was located. In the intermediate state it was held that there was *a non-fulfilment* of covenant promises, the realization of which was allied *with the Sec. Coming of Jesus*.
>p. 398 Vol. 2 Prop. 136 Obs. 6


>The Jewish view must he considered by the student. This, as stated by numerous authorities, was decided, viz., that the Patriarchs and their deceased descendants, that all who had died true Israelites, were only to be raised to glory and covenanted promises at the Coming of the Messiah.
>p. 399 Vol. 2 Prop. 136 Obs. 7

>We insist upon it that the intermediate state, expressed by the terms Hades and Sheol, continues down not only to the Second Advent, but to the end of the Mill. age.
>p. 402 Vol. 2 Prop. 136 Obs. 9

>we cannot, without violence, allow a change to have been introduced at the First Advent, viz., that saints *since then* are directly taken to heaven, and therefore do *not now* enter Hades. Such a view is opposed to *the general analogy* of the Scriptures, which makes every believer to follow the humiliation of the Master, and like Him enter Hades; it multiplies the prayer of faith given to every believer (e.g. in Ps.) for deliverance from Hades; it makes the distinguishing characteristic of Jesus at His Coming, as having “*the keys of Hades*” of no personal interest to the believer. One passage alone is decisive of two truths, viz., that the saints in Hades are *not* in heaven, and that believers at the future res. of the saints are *still* in Hades, and that is, 1 Cor. 15:54, 55, “I will redeem them from the hand of Hades, I will ransom them from death. O death, I will be thy plagues; O Hades, I will be thy destruction.”
>p. 402-403 Vol. 2 Prop. 136 Obs. 9
