>The rise, progress, aims, slaughter, etc., of the confederation of wickedness arrayed against Him (Props. 160, 101, 162, 163) will fully vindicate the propriety and consistency of the means used in its downfall; which, as prophecy declares, will be freely and universally acknowledged the world over after its occurrence.
>Obs. 1

>if in a period so disposed to be gracious He allowed His just anger to burn toward a nation still “beloved for the Father’s sake,” what will He not do when His wrath is kindled against the nations of the earth who are not thus protected by Covenant relationship?
>Obs. 1

>If God has revealed that thus it shall be, that He has ordered it, and will surely bring it to pass, that ought to satisfy the believer, especially since many of the adverse Providences of God can only now be received by faith.
>Obs. 1

>Let the nations, let the wicked open God’s Word, and if they will receive His Record, not spiritualized away, but as it is written, there they find repeated solemn warnings against joining the confederation of evildoers in the last days; against arraying themselves in hostility to Christ and His interests; against any treacherous connivance against Jerusalem or the Jewish nation. If Jerusalem becomes “a cup of trembling” and “a burdensome stone” to them; if the wrath of the Lamb burns with consuming fury against them; it is because they have rejected the most solemnly given warnings.
>Obs. 1

>Obs. 2. To appreciate this subject several things must be observed. 
>1. (1) At the period of the Sec. Advent, as various prophecies show, Christ will find a mighty array of nations who will be hostile to believers, hostile to His ancient people and land. Rev. 19:2; Thess. 2; Isa. 63, etc. He is represented, not as converting, but as destroying them; and the most terrific figures and representations are heaped one on the other to describe the catastrophe, “Making war, treading the wine-press, treading the winepress of the wrath of God, smiting the nations, ruling with a rod of iron, treading the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God, treading the people in anger, trampling on them in fury, staining His garments with the blood of His enemies,” etc., are a few of them, and under and in them is couched a dire reality against which it is worse than folly to close the eyes, viz., a most fearful period of vengeance on God’s enemies. >
>2. (2) That the ushering in of the Millennial era is immediately preceded by this period of vengeance. The context of numerous Millennial descriptions portray it as God then coming in anger, wrath, vengeance, etc., pouring out His indignation upon the nations of the earth, as e.g. Isa. 24, 25, 26, etc. 
>3. (3) An antichristian confederation is represented as existing at that time which has slaughtered the saints, and is in open war with the Jewish nation, as e.g. 2 Thess. 2; Rev. 20; Zech. 14, etc. 
>4. (4) The same is declared to exist just previous to the resurrection and deliverance of the saints, as e.g. Dan. 12:1, 2; Isa. 26:19. 
>5. (5) The same is almost invariably linked with the restoration of the Jewish nation, as e.g. Joel 3; Dan. 12, etc. 
>6. (6) The saints are also described as with Christ and participating in inflicting the judgments of God, ruling with a rod of iron, as e.g. Rev. 2:27-28, etc. 
>7. (7) The Jewish nation is likewise an agency in this last overthrow of enemies, as e.g. Zech. 14, etc. 
>It is scarcely possible in every instance to show in what way Christ, or the saints, or the Jews participate in it. The testimony of prophecy is this: that Christ as the Mighty King directly interferes in behalf of His people, that His saints aid in this work, and that the Jews are supernaturally sustained in the same. Christ as the Master Spirit and Supporter of all this, is sometimes mentioned alone (as e.g. Isa. 63), the rest being implied; again Christ and the saints in view of their associated capacity are spoken of as together (as e.g. Rev. 19), in the accomplishment of it; then again, when details are given, the Jews are described (as e.g. Zech. 12) as largely participating. The fearful picture is only completely surveyed, when the several parts are brought together and viewed as one whole. Converging and irresistible proof is also established, because under several aspects the same tremendous scene is located at precisely the same period of time introductory to the Mill, age.

>Obs. 3. Therefore, the Kingdom is introduced by violence and conflict.

>Notwithstanding the tenders of Gospel mercy, the gracious call given to Gentiles, it is predicted that not only 
>1. wickedness shall abound down to the Advent (Matt. 24:6-15, 37; Mark 13:6-13; Luke 17:26-31; 1 Thess. 5:2, 3; 2 Tim. 3:1-13; 2 Pet. 3:3, 4, 10; Jude 18, 19, etc.), 
>2. that not only antichristian powers shall exist down to that period (2 Thess. 2; Dan. 7, etc.), 
>3. but that at the time of the Advent and ushering in of the Mill, age, wickedness shall increase (Matt. 24:37-39; Luke 17:26-30; 1 Thess. 5:1-3; 2 Tim. 3:13, etc.) to a fearful extent until it culminates into a mighty confederation against the truth.
>Obs. 3 reformatted



>Through seducing influences (2 Tim. 4:1-3, etc.) and corrupting passion of nations (Ps. 2; Joel 3, etc.), there will result an organized effort to crush Christianity by persecution, and even to destroy the Jewish nation.
>Obs. 3

>Leaving the names, character, blasphemy, claims, etc., of this Antichrist, we again narrow our discussion to a single point, viz., that of his efforts to crush the Jews at Jerusalem.
>Obs. 3

>Obs. 4. This, in the nature of the conflict described, and the results that follow, indicates a prior, partial restoration of Jews to Jerusalem,

>At least one thing is certain, that the nation, as such, is at this very time represented at Jerusalem in such numerical force that prophets predict a gathering of the nations against the Jews.
>Obs. 4

>In some predictions the nations are said to do this; in others that God,
>Obs. 4

>This is reconcilable with the permissive Providence of God, and with the fact that the results of the free agency of these nations falls in with the contemplated design of God to employ the very period of their gathering and anticipated triumph for their terrible punishment.
>Obs. 4

>They shall agree among themselves, and be prospered until God is ready to pour out His vengeance; and the gathering itself on a gigantic scale with the eyes of the world fixed on it, will make the punishment the more signal and overwhelming. God employs their design as a vehicle for the accomplishment of His own; and therefore, with the power to prevent it at any time, it is correctly, although the direct result of creature agencies, attributed to Him.
>Obs. 4

>Obs. 5. Jerusalem will be taken by this last enemy, and great cruelties will be perpetrated. The Jews will be driven to despair, such as we can well imagine their blasted hopes, after long centuries of tribulation then excited by fondly anticipated prosperity, would produce. In a partial restoration attempted by themselves in reliance upon others, instead of waiting for the one to be gained through the power of their King, they suffer the last outpouring of God’s anger. This causes a cry of agony, which is mercifully heard, and in such away that sorrow and despair are turned into joy and happiness. Zech. ch. 14, delineates the extremity and the deliverance, which is corroborated by Zech. 12; Dan. 13; Jer. 30:4-24. The Lord will fight for them; and among the agencies employed is this very Jewish nation, as specified. Zech. 14:14, “Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem, etc.


>Obs. 6. The active part taken by this Jewish nation in the punishment of the nations who opposed Jerusalem, etc., is given in Zech. 12:1—9; Zech. 10:3-12; Micah 4:11-13; Isa. 41:15-16; Micah 5:8-10; Jer. 51:19-20, etc., verifying Dan. 2 and 7 and 12; Ps. 2, etc.

>The nations will be confounded at their valor and might, Micah 7:16, 17; Zech. 9:13-16, etc. The slaughter will be terrific, represented under the most impressive figures that language can employ, as e.g. Ezek. 38 and 39 the awful supper “upon the mountains of Israel” to which the birds and beasts are invited, Rev. 19:17-20, same supper, Rev. 14:19, 20; Jer. 25:29-33, etc.
>Obs. 6

>The hesitancy of many writers, who receive it, to dwell upon it arises not from disbelief or disregard, but from the fear that others not appreciating its relationship to the judgments of God preparatory to the establishment of Sis own Theocratic government, may become prejudiced against the truth in general.
>Obs. 6

>The time of wrath on the nations and of the Kingdom will also come, Rev. 11:15-18. Now, during the gathering out of the elect, vengeance is God’s; we are forbidden to exercise it; but God’s forbearance with Gentiles will also end as it did with Jerusalem, as it now does with individuals, and then He employs what agencies He pleases to cause their destruction.
>Obs. 7

>Obs. 8. This future overthrow of the nations is the key to the warlike spirit noticed in many of the Psalms, and which has been the fruitful subject of derision to unbelievers.

Ps. 58:10; 68:23,
Ps. 149:6, 7, 8, 9?

>Obs. 9. This subject in one of its features, ought to serve as a warning to Jews, not to allow themselves to be persuaded by any nation or party to establish themselves in Jerusalem and Palestine. The prophets plainly predict their sad fate; that they shall fall under the persecuting power of this last confederation and experience its fearful effects. The restoration that God predicts for them, and which they should await, is under the Messiah, Jesus Christ, David’s Son. If they run before they are called, or if they accept of a restoration under the auspices of some nation relying upon their own efforts, etc., they shall certainly realize in their own unhappy experience what will befall Jerusalem and its inhabitants at this last great siege by the gathered nations.

>Obs. 10. This also should serve as a warning to the nations, not to allow themselves by any arguments or inducements to enter into a league against Jerusalem.

>true wisdom ought to indicate a persistent refusal to all solicitations to engage against the ancient city and people of God,
>Obs. 10
