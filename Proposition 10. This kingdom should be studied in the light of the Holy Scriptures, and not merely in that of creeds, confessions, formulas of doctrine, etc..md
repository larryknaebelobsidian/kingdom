### Obs. 5

> The exceeding multitude of interpretations, with their variegated hues, has led persons to fix some limit, thus attempting to perform what God has not prescribed outside the Scriptures, for God holds us only responsible *for the plain, naked, grammatical sense of the Word*, and not for recondite, hidden senses that the ingenuity or imagination of man may concoct.
> p. 130 Vol. 1 Prop. 10 Obs. 5

> Two extremes must be avoided; the exclusion of reason, and the admission of nothing but reason.
> - Oosterzee (*Ch. Dog.*, vol. p. 159)
> p. 135 Vol. 1 Prop. 10 Obs. 8
