### Undue reverence for human authority
>Obs. 1. This Proposition in its definite statement is the more needed, since at the present day multitudes find themselves so fettered by an undue reverence for human authority, as presented in and through the church, that it is scarcely possible to get them to consider any subject in its true scriptural aspect.

### Creeds are only good to a point
>Obs. 2. Creeds, etc., valuable as they are in many respects, can only, at best, give their testimony as witnesses to the truth; and they can only testify to as much of it as the framers themselves have seen and experienced.

>It is a bad indication when, in any period, men will so exalt their confessions that they force the Scriptures to a secondary importance, illustrated in one era, when, as Tulloch (Leaders of the Ref or., p. 87) remarks: “Scripture as a witness, disappeared behind the Augsburg Confession.”
>Obs. 2
### Bible is our only infallible rule of faith and practice
>Obs. 3. The Bible, then, is our only infallible rule of faith and practice, as many of the Confessions of Faith distinctly declare.

### Kingdom not specially treated in confessions
>The doctrine of the kingdom, although prominently in the Bible, is not specially treated in the earlier Confessions, as e.g. the Apostles’, Niceno-Constantinopolitan, and Athanasian.
>Obs. 4

>The doctrine as upheld by us is contained in very few Confessions, is ignored by others, and is misapprehended and opposed in others.
>Obs. 4

>It is strange that but few Confessions make the kingdom, a distinctive article of faith, and from this, no doubt, results in a measure the great variety and latitude of meanings given to it. The reasons why our doctrine has not received a confessional prominency, will be presented under following propositions.
>Obs. 4

### Responsible for the plain, naked, grammatical sense of the Word
> The exceeding multitude of interpretations, with their variegated hues, has led persons to fix some limit, thus attempting to perform what God has not prescribed outside the Scriptures, for God holds us only responsible *for the plain, naked, grammatical sense of the Word*, and not for recondite, hidden senses that the ingenuity or imagination of man may concoct.
> p. 130 Vol. 1 Prop. 10 Obs. 5

### Personal responsibility
>Obs. 6. One of the fruits of the Reformation is the recovery and firm reestablishment of the principle that all have the privilege of judging for themselves in matters of religion.

>The entire framework of the Scriptures is erected on the idea of personal responsibility enhanced by the ability to discern the truth for ourselves.
>Obs. 6

### Confidence is not the authority
>Obs. 7. It is also a perversion to make (as in Essays and Reviews) confidence the supreme Judge to decide upon the meaning, merits, authority, etc., of Scripture, and that the latter must bend to the decisions of the former.


### Avoid two extremes - no reason and all reason
> Two extremes must be avoided; the exclusion of reason, and the admission of nothing but reason.
> - Oosterzee (*Ch. Dog.*, vol. p. 159)
> p. 135 Vol. 1 Prop. 10 Obs. 8

### Reason and faith must be joined
>Obs. 9. In this study of Scripture, reason and faith must be joined together in order to make it effective.

>Reason may refuse faith, can exist without it, but faith cannot live without reason.
>Obs. 9
