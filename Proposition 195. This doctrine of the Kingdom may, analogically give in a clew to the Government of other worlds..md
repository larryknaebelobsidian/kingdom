# Proposition 195. This doctrine of the Kingdom may, analogically give in a clew to the Government of other worlds.
##### Personal Note: I find this a strange proposition that I had never seriously considered before 

>The astronomical idea of the vast plurality of worlds (which Paine and others so offensively parade over against the reasonable representations of Newton, Boyle, Bacon, Chalmers, Fuller, Brewster, etc.) is in all probability the correct one. The Scriptures dealing almost exclusively with man and this world, still indirectly, by speaking of intelligences outside of this world and by various references to the creative power of God, the magnitude of His work, etc., make the view a consistent one.

>we may, from analogy, draw the inference that other worlds are also governed by similar *Theocratic* government;...

### Redemption in other worlds doubtful
>Obs. 1. It is true that this Theocratic arrangement by which God and man are brought into union and fellowship is one instituted in a fallen world, and a peculiarity, distinguishing it from others, may exist in the union of God with David’s Son for *Redemptive* purpose.
>...
>It is, however, extremely doubtful whether other worlds need Redemption like ours,

### Theocracy appears to be God's preferred even for other worlds
>Obs. 2. The Will of God done on earth as it is in heaven, evinces the fact that it is only performed or carried out when nations *are thus Theocratically* governed; and hence, that the Divine Will *favors* such a form of government, as being correspondent with heaven itself. Now, if God thus *identifies* Himself with so small a world in the interest and happiness of His creatures, and even condescends to a relationship with humanity through David’s Son to cause the Will of God to be done on earth as in heaven, we may readily conclude that He will not be *less identified* with other worlds in a form of government similar in kind, modified to suit the peculiar status of the creature, and influenced, if need he, by the special manifestation of it here in the person of Jesus Christ.

### David and Solomon hints
>Obs. 3. The questions of David (Ps. 8:3, 4) and Solomon (2 Chron. 6:18) are only satisfactorily answered on the supposition of the vast extent and inhabited (intelligent) condition of other worlds, and that the visiting and dwelling of God spoken of have reference to this Theocratical order, a relationship similar to that enjoyed by other worlds, but for which this world has made itself unworthy on account of sin.
>p. 445 Vol. 3 Prop. 195 Obs. 3
### Contact with other worlds
>Obs. 4. This Kingdom—Theocratic-Davidic—is represented as bringing this world into direct communication and fellowship with the Universe. Owing to rebellion, the angelic hosts, which once shouted for joy at the exhibition of creative energy, withdrew from this world, and only occasionally have they been permitted to reveal themselves to man. But this interdiction, caused by sinfulness, will be withdrawn, for on the restoration of this Kingdom, under the blessed reign of Christ, they shall freely communicate with this earth as Jesus told Nathaniel (John 1:51). This also indicates that the government thus instituted, which restores such intercommunication, is in full accord with that in other parts of the Universe. And as many able writers have asserted as highly probable, there may be, the saints being made equal unto angels, and their transportation being dependent upon their will, communication by the saints with other worlds thus practically and effectively presenting in the persons of the redeemed the work of Redemption. Thus the redeemed may be employed to show forth (Eph. 3:10) “the manifold wisdom of God,” and “the unsearchable riches of Christ,” answerable to the desire (1 Pet. 1:12) of even angels, and to the wide extent (Rev. 5:13) to which the knowledge of the Lamb and ascriptions of praise to Him shall progress.

### Constitution of the Theocracy evidences a union
>Obs. 5. This union, however, with other worlds, is evidenced by the very constitution of the Theocracy itself as realized and exhibited in the person of the Theocratic King and His associated Rulers.
