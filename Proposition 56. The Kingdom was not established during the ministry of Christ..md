>This necessarily follows from the preceding; for *no such* a covenanted Kingdom as promised, *no such* a restored Davidic throne and Kingdom as predicted *appeared*. He (Luke 19:11-27) had to leave before he would receive (Prop. 83) the Kingdom.

>Obs. 1. The men who were the preachers of this very Kingdom, and who, above all others (especially modern theologians), ought to have known whether it was instituted or not, had no knowledge whatever of its being thus erected.

>Obs. 2. The apostles, the best judges in the matter, knew nothing about a Kingdom set up; and therefore, consistently with covenant and prophecy, with former preaching and instruction, with desire and hope ask, Acts 1:6, “Lord, wilt Thou at this time restore again the Kingdom to Israel?” The reply of Jesus confirms their view of existing facts; for instead of telling them that they were mistaken in their idea of the Kingdom, that the Kingdom already existed, etc. (according to the Alexandrian formulas), the answer, referring to the “times and seasons,” implies on its very face that they did not misapprehend the nature of the Kingdom (comp. Prop. 43). They, like Joseph of Arimathea (Mark 15:43), “also waited for the Kingdom of God”

>Obs. 3. Jesus, before His death, declared the Kingdom to be still future (comp. Props. 58, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, etc.).

>Obs. 4. The significant fact that our opponents cannot tell when this promised Kingdom was set up, although professing that it was established, is corroborative evidence in our favor.

Various theories as to when the kingdom began
1. Under John the Baptist
2. Birth of Jesus
3. Commencement of Jesus' ministry
4. Commissioning of the disciples
5. Confession of Peter
6. At Christ's death
7. At Christ's resurrection and ascension
8. Day of Pentecost
9. Destruction of Jerusalem

>Obs. 5. That no Kingdom, as covenanted, was set up, is corroborated by the entire tenor of the Gospels and Epistles, and forbids, if sheer inference is laid aside, the notion to be entertained.

>Obs. 6. This nighness of the Kingdom to the nation was evidenced not merely by the offer of the Kingdom, but by the tender of it in the person of Jesus Christ.

>Obs. 7. The reader will observe that there is not a single declaration of Christ’s which asserts that the Kingdom was then in actual existence.

>Now, while it is true that the Kingdom in a certain sense (Obs. 6) was in Christ, and brought nigh by Him to the nation, yet it is wrong and misleading to infer from this that it was established. The contrary, as held by the early Church, is the truth. It is in view of this unwarranted inference that such writers take the great and unauthorized liberty of changing the phrase “nigh at hand” into “now established,” “now founded,” “now already present,” etc.
>Obs. 9

>Obs. 10. Here, at this preaching of the Kingdom as nigh at hand, so many stumble and fall into serious error (comp. Props. 38, 42, 55).

>In the light of Scripture there is *no excuse* for the prevailing interpretations respecting the Kingdom, for, over against the meanings engrafted by man, there is *an abundance* to satisfy the reverent Student that they are utterly untenable. Without attempting to forestall the proof that the following Propositions contain, it may be well to say that numerous passages directly affirm, or imply, our position. Take e.g. Matt. 26:29, Mark 14:25, and Jesus in the expressions “*until that day*” locates the Kingdom in the future, which is made more emphatic by Luke (22:18) saying: “*Until the Kingdom of God shall come*." If the Kingdom already existed, such phraseology would be entirely out of place, but with our view it is *consistent and significant*. The general tenor of the Word indicates the same feature. Thus e.g. when Jesus speaks of entering into the Kingdom of heaven (Matt. 7:21, 22), its futurity is expressed by the phrase “*in that day*,” i.e., it is something not present to be realized at once. So also in the prayer “*thy Kingdom come*,” the futurity of which was believed in by the disciples, and which excited the petition (for the prayer was given in accordance with the well-known views of the disciples) lust before the ascension. Acts 1:6. Thus in Matt. 19:28, Luke 22:29, by adopting the Jewish phraseology linked with the Messianic Kingdom, Jesus conclusively teaches that the Kingdom is future and not present.

>Obs. 13. The distinctive preaching of Jesus, based as it is on the covenants, throws light on the vexed question pertaining to the relation that He sustained to the law. He observed the law Himself and enjoined it upon others, and yet intimated, in the destruction of the temple, etc., the abrogation of the Mosaic law. But we must carefully distinguish when the latter was done, viz. after the representative men of the nation had conspired against Him, and after He had revealed His rejection by the nation.
