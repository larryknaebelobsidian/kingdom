>This necessarily follows from the preceding; for *no such* a covenanted Kingdom as promised, *no such* a restored Davidic throne and Kingdom as predicted *appeared*. He (Luke 19:11-27) had to leave before he would receive (Prop. 83) the Kingdom.

>In the light of Scripture there is *no excuse* for the prevailing interpretations respecting the Kingdom, for, over against the meanings engrafted by man, there is *an abundance* to satisfy the reverent Student that they are utterly untenable. Without attempting to forestall the proof that the following Propositions contain, it may be well to say that numerous passages directly affirm, or imply, our position. Take e.g. Matt. 26:29, Mark 14:25, and Jesus in the expressions “*until that day*” locates the Kingdom in the future, which is made more emphatic by Luke (22:18) saying: “*Until the Kingdom of God shall come*." If the Kingdom already existed, such phraseology would be entirely out of place, but with our view it is *consistent and significant*. The general tenor of the Word indicates the same feature. Thus e.g. when Jesus speaks of entering into the Kingdom of heaven (Matt. 7:21, 22), its futurity is expressed by the phrase “*in that day*,” i.e., it is something not present to be realized at once. So also in the prayer “*thy Kingdom come*,” the futurity of which was believed in by the disciples, and which excited the petition (for the prayer was given in accordance with the well-known views of the disciples) lust before the ascension. Acts 1:6. Thus in Matt. 19:28, Luke 22:29, by adopting the Jewish phraseology linked with the Messianic Kingdom, Jesus conclusively teaches that the Kingdom is future and not present.
