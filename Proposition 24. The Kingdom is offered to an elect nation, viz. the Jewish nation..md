Deuteronomy 14:2
2 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for His treasured possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.

Romans 11:28
28 From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of _God’s_ choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers;

Romans 9:11
11 for though _the twins_ were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that the purpose of God according to _His_ choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,

> the sovereignty of God chose in the descendants of Abraham, the Jews, a people *through whom* should be manifested his Divine purpose in the salvation of man.
> p. 207 Vol. 1 Prop. 24

> This election is not to be regarded, as some tell us, an act of favoritism, but as founded in *that wisdom* which adopted it (as the end will manifest) as the best means, under the circumstances in which fallen humanity was placed, to reach, consistently with moral freedom, the largest portion of mankind, having in view the ultimate establishment and triumph -- in opposition to depravity -- of God's Kingdom.
> p. 207 Vol. 1 Prop. 24

## The Reason for Election
Deut. 7:7-11
7 “Yahweh did not set His affection on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples, 8 but because Yahweh loved you and kept the oath which He swore to your fathers, Yahweh brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 9 You shall know therefore that Yahweh your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments; 10 but repays those who hate Him to their faces, to make them perish; He will not delay with him who hates Him, He will repay him to his face. 11 Therefore, you shall keep the commandment and the statutes and the judgments which I am commanding you today, to do them.

### Obs. 1
> The Kingdom itself thus offered to them is a *divine-political* (church and state unified) dominion, over which *God Himself, as an earthly Ruler*, presides or rules as the Supreme.
> p. 207 Vol. 1 Prop. 24 Obs. 1

### Obs. 3
>While the nation, comprising the natural descendants of Abraham, is thus chosen, it does not follow that every individual in it is thus personally elected. The election is *twofold* -- in its reach after the nationality, and in its application to the individual member of the nation.  It, in the latter case, only pertains to the believing, obedient portion of the nation.  This Paul, in Rom. 9 and 11, distinctly teaches.
>p. 209 Vol. 1 Prop. 24 Obs. 3


### Obs. 4
>How comes it, then, that the covenants are given to the Jewish race? That this election is confined to the Jewish race and those adopted into that race? That the election is traced directly through the descendants of Abraham and those incorporated as Abraham’s seed? That all the prophets, all the inspired teachers,, Jesus and the apostles, are Jews? That the election of the nation is recognized by Jesus and the apostles, and that the Gentiles were only afterward admitted by special revelation, and then only as the acknowledged children of Abraham?
  . . . The misapprehension arises from not discriminating that the true seed are faithful Jews, or become such by faith, being *the actual* descendants of Abraham, or *accounted such -- part of the race* to whom the covenants are given. It does not follow, because God designs to exalt and bless the nation, that a disobedient Jew will obtain the blessings of election; for while the race, as a race, is chosen, it is not said that every individual of the race is also ultimately chosen.  The fact is, that very few, comparatively, may avail themselves of the opportunity afforded; but that does not vitiate the election of the portion of the race that is faithful, and it does not alter God's final purpose in reference to the nation itself.
> p. 210-211 Vol. 1 Prop. 24 Obs. 4

### Obs. 5
> If any one says (as, alas, many do), perverting the language of Paul applicable to another feature, that the having the blood of Abraham in their veins amounted to nothing (which is true, when accompanied by unbelief, as Jesus taught), he simply fails to recognize the plain fact *that Jews* were called, and *not* Gentiles; a covenant was made *with Jews, and not* with Gentiles; the promises were given *to Jews*, and *not* to Gentiles; and that Gentiles receive and inherit *with* the natural descendants of Abraham *only as they are incorporated.*
> p. 212 Vol. 1 Prop. 24 Obs. 5

### Obs. 6
>it is inconsistent to make (as e.g. Fairbairn, Whately and others) this elect people *a type* of others -- the type of a future people -- thus misapplying the word "Israel."
>p. 212 Vol. 1 Prop. 24 Obs. 6

### Obs. 8
> The Scriptures simply declare, that the "wall" is broken down between natural Jewish and Gentile *believers*, so that all of every nationality, *when exercising faith* in Jesus, become *one* in Christ.
> p. 213 Vol. 1 Prop. 24 Obs. 8

> Thus e.g. to *the natural* descendants of Abraham is *exclusively* given a covenant with certain promises; only those who are *identified* with the nation -- this distinctive race -- *have any right* to the covenanted blessings. The nation is chosen not merely as a depositary of the truth, but as the vehicle or medium through which the Saviour is to come, and finally completed Redemption in *a manifested Kingdom* under the reign of that Redeemer; for, somehow, all the prophets link the glory of the Messianic Kingdom *with* the Jewish race.  The individual Jew, on the principle of faith, can only justly claim the promises given by covenant to his people.
> p. 214 Vol. 1 Prop. 24 Obs. 8

> The Mosaic economy -- likened also to a wall or fortification -- introduced to preserve intact the elect nation . . .
> p. 214 Vol. 1 Prop. 24 Obs. 8

> (The nation as portrayed as a root-stump, holy seed) is regarded sacred, and will ultimately become holy.
> p. 215 Vol. 1 Prop. 24 Obs. 9
 
> The punishment, the scattering and desolation, of the Jewish nation is itself proof of their election as, e.g. Amos (ch. 3:2), declares : "You only have I known of all the families of the earth : *therefore* I will punish you for all your iniquities."  This casting off is only *temporary*, as evidence e.g. Zech. 10:6, etc.
> p. 215 Vol. 1 Prop. 24 Obs. 9


Zechariah 10:6
I will make the house of Judah mighty,
And I will save the house of Joseph,
And I will cause them to return,
Because I have had compassion on them;
And they will be as though I had not rejected them,
For I am Yahweh their God, and I will answer them.
