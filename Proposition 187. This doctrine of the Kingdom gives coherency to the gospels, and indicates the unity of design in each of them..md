>It has been objected to the gospels that they are greatly composed of detached, fragmentary parts strung together without unity of design, presenting varied, and, in a measure, contradictory, sketches of the life of Jesus. This is effectually disproven by looking at the gospels from the Kingdom standpoint; for then it appears that each writer had a definite object in view, viz., to evince unity and a consistent development of Divine Purpose in a pre-determined Plan corresponding with the covenants and prophecies relating to the Kingdom.

>Obs. 1. In order to ascertain the design of the gospels and to comprehend the unity therein, the student must place himself, not in the modern position of thought, but in the posture of those to whom these gospels were first presented.

>The more the gospels are contemplated in the light of the covenants and of the facts as they existed at the First Advent, the more logically consistent, the more connected and admirably adapted to secure the design intended, will they appear.
>Obs. 1

>Matthew’s Gospel is thus exhibited as a strictly consecutive, logical array of facts to establish the Messiahship of Jesus over against objectors who would allege the non-fulfilment of the covenanted promises in that no Kingdom, such as covenanted, was then established.
>Obs. 2

>Matthew, as well as the other evangelists, takes it for granted that the reader of the Gospel is previously well posted in covenant and prophecy, and hence writes for such persons. Therefore, a simple statement of facts, as they occurred, is all that is required to lead a believer in covenant and prophecy to acknowledge Jesus as “the Christ,” who will yet fulfil them, as claimed, at His Second Coming. This was the universal belief of those Christians who first received and perpetuated the Gospel, thus verifying, in the reception of it, our doctrinal position.
>Obs. 2

>Obs. 3. Mark’s Gospel follows precisely the same method.

>Obs. 4. Luke, writing at the time he did, must also follow the same course, viz., to meet the objections that might be alleged against a crucified Messiah and the non-appearance of the Messianic Kingdom.

>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, in the conferring of supernatural power, which embraces the same ability to perform all things, hold forth Jesus as the predicted One, who, as David’s Son, is higher than the kings of the earth, the promised Theocratic King.
>Obs. 3

>Hence the Gospel of John exhibits one trait differing from the preceding gospels (and yet also mentioned by them) which gives it a remarkable complexion, viz., it commences at once with His rejection and death, with the implied postponement of the Kingdom, and call of the Gentiles.
>Obs. 3

>What the other evangelists only mention after a regular series of introductory statements, John specifies at once as something well understood in his day. Here we find the true logical attachment of John’s Gospel with the others, and the perfect harmony existing between them becomes apparent.

>Obs. 5


>The true key to the proper comprehension of John’s Gospel is to notice the first point of contact between it and the previously given Gospels, viz., that the God-given Divine Messiah was rejected by His own elect nation, and consequently the implication (afterward enforced) that the blessings of the Messianic Kingdom (as covenanted and predicted) are delayed until He is again manifested at “the last day.”
>Obs. 5

>Obs. 6. Our position is abundantly confirmed by the succeeding Acts.

>Obs. 7. The critical reader will observe that our argument respecting the Gospels brings forth new and additional reasons why the Gospels could not have been written at as late a period as some destructive critics assume. The very form in which the Gospels are given indicates an early origin; for the design manifested in answering certain objections shows that it meets the only objections that were current immediately after the death of Jesus and opposed to His claims of Messiahship.

>Obs. 8. Thus comprehended, the Gospels answer the question, which unbelief has never yet been able to meet, how it comes that Jews, looking for a Messiah, as described by covenant and prophecy exalted to the restored throne and Kingdom of David, should accept of a crucified Jesus as such a Messiah.

>Obs. 9. This view of the design of the Gospels shows how unfounded is the assertion of Schleiermacher and others, that it is impossible to prove that Jesus is the Messiah from the prophecies.

>The defence of the Messiahship of Jesus in the Gospels is based upon two facts, constantly appealed to, viz., that Jesus in His manifestation, etc ..fulfilled the prophets, and that by a certain determinate fulfilment He gives us sufficient evidence that the remainder will be fulfilled at the period of time designated.
>Obs. 9
