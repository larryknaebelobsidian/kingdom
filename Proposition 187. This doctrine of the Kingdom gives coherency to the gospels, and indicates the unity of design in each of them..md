>It has been objected to the gospels that they are greatly composed of detached, fragmentary parts strung together without unity of design, presenting varied, and, in a measure, contradictory, sketches of the life of Jesus. This is effectually disproven by looking at the gospels from the Kingdom standpoint; for then it appears that each writer had a definite object in view, viz., to evince unity and a consistent development of Divine Purpose in a pre-determined Plan corresponding with the covenants and prophecies relating to the Kingdom.

>Obs. 1. In order to ascertain the design of the gospels and to comprehend the unity therein, the student must place himself, not in the modern position of thought, hat in the posture of those to whom these gospels were first presented.
