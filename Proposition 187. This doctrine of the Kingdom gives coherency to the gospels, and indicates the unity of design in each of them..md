# Proposition 187. This doctrine of the Kingdom gives coherency to the gospels, and indicates the unity of design in each of them.

>This must follow, provided the doctrine of the Kingdom is as leading and doctrinally fundamental as represented. It has been objected to the gospels that they are greatly composed of detached, fragmentary parts strung together without unity of design, presenting varied, and, in a measure, contradictory, sketches of the life of Jesus. This is effectually disproven by looking at the gospels from the Kingdom standpoint; for then it appears that each writer had a definite object in view, viz., to evince unity and a consistent development of Divine Purpose in a pre-determined Plan corresponding with the covenants and prophecies relating to the Kingdom.
### Perspective of the first recipients of the gospels
>Obs. 1. In order to ascertain the design of the gospels and to comprehend the unity therein, the student must place himself, not in the modern position of thought, but in the posture of those to whom these gospels were first presented. Then, all who read the Old Test, entertained the Theocratic-Davidic idea of the Messiah and Kingdom; all believed that a descendant of David, specially related (Theocratically) to God, would appear, who would restore the throne and Kingdom of David and reign majestically as the prophets predicted. Now, in the very nature of the case, writing for such persons who received the covenants and prophecies in their grammatical construction, it was requisite, in view of what actually occurred, to show that Jesus was a descendant of David; that He was related to and acknowledged by God; that He was the powerful Messiah; that the Kingdom was tendered to the elect nation; that the nation, through its representative men, rejected the Messiah and Kingdom; that this Messiah, foreseeing His rejection and death, must give assurances indicative of the postponement of the Kingdom; and that, notwithstanding His death, He is able to re-establish the Kingdom. Now, these are precisely the points that are fully presented in the gospels;

>The more the gospels are contemplated in the light of the covenants and of the facts as they existed at the First Advent, the more logically consistent, the more connected and admirably adapted to secure the design intended, will they appear.
>Obs. 1
### Matthew's statements
>Obs. 2. Briefly consider Matthew’s statements to vindicate the claims of a crucified Jesus to the Messiahship as covenanted.

>The promised Messiah is one who must, in order to fulfil the covenants and promises as given, be able to exert supernatural power;
>Obs. 2

>Matthew’s Gospel is thus exhibited as a strictly consecutive, logical array of facts to establish the Messiahship of Jesus over against objectors who would allege the non-fulfilment of the covenanted promises in that no Kingdom, such as covenanted, was then established.
>Obs. 2

>Matthew, as well as the other evangelists, takes it for granted that the reader of the Gospel is previously well posted in covenant and prophecy, and hence writes for such persons. Therefore, a simple statement of facts, as they occurred, is all that is required to lead a believer in covenant and prophecy to acknowledge Jesus as “the Christ,” who will yet fulfil them, as claimed, at His Second Coming. This was the universal belief of those Christians who first received and perpetuated the Gospel, thus verifying, in the reception of it, our doctrinal position.
>Obs. 2
### Mark's statements
>Obs. 3. Mark’s Gospel follows precisely the same method.
### Luke's statements
>Obs. 4. Luke, writing at the time he did, must also follow the same course, viz., to meet the objections that might be alleged against a crucified Messiah and the non-appearance of the Messianic Kingdom.

>Luke adds, what the other two Gospels take for granted (ch. 24:44-53), that the wonderful exhibition of the Messiah confirmed the faith of the disciples in believing, that this crucified but resurrected Jesus was indeed the Messiah, in and through whom the Scriptures would be fulfilled.
>Obs. 4
### John's statements
Obs. 5
>it is a sufficient answer to all such criticism to show that John treads precisely the same path gone over by the other Gospels, in answering the objections that might be brought against the Messiahship of Jesus on the ground of His crucifixion and the non-establishment of the Messianic Kingdom.
>Obs. 5

>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, in the conferring of supernatural power, which embraces the same ability to perform all things, hold forth Jesus as the predicted One, who, as David’s Son, is higher than the kings of the earth, the promised Theocratic King.
>Obs. 5

>The careful student will notice that John, in the very beginning of his Gospel, proclaims the rejection of Jesus by the Jews (so ch. 1:5, 11, ch. 2:24), and now again (ch. 3:19) repeats it, while holding Him up as the appointed Saviour, and declaring that even His death (already predicted, ch. 2:21, 22) was an appointed means (e.g. through the resurrection, etc.) to save the world.
>Obs. 5

>Hence the Gospel of John exhibits one trait differing from the preceding gospels (and yet also mentioned by them) which gives it a remarkable complexion, viz., it commences at once with His rejection and death, with the implied postponement of the Kingdom, and call of the Gentiles. What the other evangelists only mention after a regular series of introductory statements, John specifies at once as something well understood in his day. Here we find the true logical attachment of John’s Gospel with the others, and the perfect harmony existing between them becomes apparent.
>Obs. 5

>Jesus, in explanation of the declaration, “I and my Father are One,” declares it an equivalent to (vs. 36, 38) “i am the Son of God,” “the Father in Me and I in Him,” and this corresponds with the covenanted language that David’s Son was also to be God’s Son, in whom the Theocracy is to be evermore established,
>Obs. 5

>The true key to the proper comprehension of John’s Gospel is to notice the first point of contact between it and the previously given Gospels, viz., that the God-given Divine Messiah was rejected by His own elect nation, and consequently the implication (afterward enforced) that the blessings of the Messianic Kingdom (as covenanted and predicted) are delayed until He is again manifested at “the last day.”
>Obs. 5
### Acts statements
>Obs. 6. Our position is abundantly confirmed by the succeeding Acts.
### Evidence of early origin of Gospels
>Obs. 7. The critical reader will observe that our argument respecting the Gospels brings forth new and additional reasons why the Gospels could not have been written at as late a period as some destructive critics assume. The very form in which the Gospels are given indicates an early origin; for the design manifested in answering certain objections shows that it meets the only objections that were current immediately after the death of Jesus and opposed to His claims of Messiahship.

>The simple form of ending each Gospel with the resurrection of Jesus, the omission of any detailed statement of the call of the Gentiles, the points of contact with the Jewish position, the firm and unwavering conformation with covenant and prophecy, are all opposed to the notion of a later origin, seeing that the inevitable tendency of enlargement, apology, change, reflections, etc., from the more modern standpoint (already feeling the effects of an incorporated philosophy and division of sentiment, etc.) would have been, more or less, made manifest.
>Obs. 7
### Why accept Jesus crucified as the Messiah
>Obs. 8. Thus comprehended, the Gospels answer the question, which unbelief has never yet been able to meet, how it comes that Jews, looking for a Messiah, as described by covenant and prophecy exalted to the restored throne and Kingdom of David, should accept of a crucified Jesus as such a Messiah.

>The secret for such an acceptance lies in the fact that every inspired teacher took the position that both covenant and prophecy would be fulfilled by this same Jesus at His Second Advent, and that His claims to the Messiahship were so sustained by His birth, life, death, and resurrection that we could have the strongest assurance—in a thus far fulfilled Word of God—that that which has been postponed will inevitably be realized.
>Obs. 8
### Jesus fulfilled some prophecies, gives assurance of the rest
>Obs. 9. This view of the design of the Gospels shows how unfounded is the assertion of Schleiermacher and others, that it is impossible to prove that Jesus is the Messiah from the prophecies. The defence of the Messiahship of Jesus in the Gospels is based upon two facts, constantly appealed to, viz., that Jesus in His manifestation, etc ..fulfilled the prophets, and that by a certain determinate fulfilment He gives us sufficient evidence that the remainder will be fulfilled at the period of time designated.
