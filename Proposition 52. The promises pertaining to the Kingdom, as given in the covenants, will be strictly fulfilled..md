>A covenant must, in the nature of the case, be understood by the parties to whom it is given; the language employed is that ordinarily used, so that the ideas intended may be accurately expressed.
>p. 342 Vol. 1 Prop 52
### Disobedience caused the house to be desolate, tabernacle fallen down
>if his seed would have yielded obedience, David’s throne would *never* have been vacated until the Seed, par excellence, came; but being disobedient, the throne was overthrown, and will remain thus “*a tabernacle fallen down*” “*a house desolate*,” *until* rebuilt and restored by the Seed.
>p. 343 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 2

>14. No grammatical rule *can* be laid down which will make David’s throne to be the Father’s throne in the third heaven.
>p. 343 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 2

>16. . . . if David’s throne is the Father’s throne in heaven (the usual interpretation), *then* it must have existed forever.
>p. 343 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 2

>18. God is faithful in His promises, and *deceives no one* in the language of His covenants.
>p. 344 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 2

>20. The *identical* throne and Kingdom overthrown are the ones restored.
>p. 344 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 2

>... These, in connection with the covenants themselves, make David’s throne and Kingdom a requisite for the display of that *Theocratic* ordering which God has already instituted (but now holds in abeyance until the preparations are completed) for the restoration and exaltation of the Jewish nation (which is preserved for this purpose), for the salvation of the human race (which comes under the Theocratic blessing), and for the dominion of a renewed, curse-delivered world (the Theocratic arrangement making this possible and a realization). Such a throne and Kingdom *are necessary to preserve the Divine Unity of Purpose in the already proposed Theocratic line*. Thus early in our argument reference is made to this point, not so much to prove it as to direct the reader’s attention to it, because it is a *goal* to which the path of Scripture *directly leads us*, as it led the Primitive Church.
>p. 344 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 2
### Theocratic
>It was truly a *Theocratic Kingdom*; and this *Theocratic basis* is the reason why God takes such an interest in its re-establishment. It is Christ’s “inheritance,” because it is *Theocratic*; and it is this Divine aspect which makes it, as represented, *worthy* of the Son of Man.
>p. 348 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 5
### Earthly and political
>... the predictions and hopes of the prophets are *invariably associated with the earthly and political* existence of the nation, ...
>--Reuss (*His. Ch. Apos. Age*, p.32)
>p. 348 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 6
### Covenants are the keystone 
>. . . “the *keystone* of the whole system” (i.e. Millenarian) is not to be found, as Prof. Sanborn (Essay on Mill.), in the pre-Millennial Advent (however indispensable), but in the covenants. The promises are not in the Sec. Advent, but in the covenants and prophecies based on them; the Advent being only *the necessary means* toward their accomplishment.
>p. 348 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 7
### Carefully guarded language
>The extremely guarded language of Scripture on this point, so as not to conflict with the covenanted promise, should lead the student to reflection. 
>. . . through all the Scriptures, as will be shown hereafter, there is a carefully drawn distinction between what belongs to Jesus Christ because of His relationship as God, and what pertains to Him by promise, by right, by inheritance, by the redemptive work that He is accomplishing because of His Messiahship *as David’s Son*, the promised Theocratic King.
>p. 349 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 9
### Visible and eternal, not merely spiritual
>. . . the Messianic Kingdom is *a visible, external* Kingdom, not merely spiritual, although embracing spiritual and divine things.
>p. 351 Vol. 1 Prop 52 Obs. 14
