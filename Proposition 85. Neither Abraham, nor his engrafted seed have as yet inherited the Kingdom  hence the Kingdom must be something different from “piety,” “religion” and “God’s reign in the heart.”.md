# Proposition 85. Neither Abraham, nor his engrafted seed have as yet inherited the Kingdom hence the Kingdom must be something different from “piety,” “religion” and “God’s reign in the heart.”

>We have shown that Abraham is to inherit the promises in this Kingdom (Prop. 49, etc.), and that saints inherit with him (Prop. 62, 63, etc.). The time of inheriting the Kingdom is specified, in accordance with our argument, e. g., in Matt. 25:34. Therefore to make “piety,” etc., the kingdom is an incongruity. To say that the Patriarchs were in this Kingdom, before the Advent of “the Christ,” is a palpable absurdity; to infer that they and others are now in it, when it has not appeared in its covenanted form, and when it has been postponed to the Sec. Advent, is equally unworthy of credence.
### Means to obtain the kingdom is different than the kingdom itself
>Obs. 1. This is virtually to make “piety” inherit “piety.” This is a substitution of the means by which the Kingdom is obtained for the Kingdom itself.
### Unjust reflections and comparisons
>Obs. 2. With the idea that believers now enjoy the Kingdom in the present dispensation, the most unjust reflections and comparisons are instituted derogatory to the ancient worthies.
