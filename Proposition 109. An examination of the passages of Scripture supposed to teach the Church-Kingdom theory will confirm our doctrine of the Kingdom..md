### Key passage

#### John 18:36
Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I would not be delivered over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not from here.”

>The view that we have all along maintained is this, viz., that this Kingdom, Theocratic-Davidic, is *of* divine origin and is specially claimed *as* God’s, *He Himself* being the Ruler in and through the reigning King; that this Kingdom, being *not* of worldly but divine outgrowth, is promised to Jesus Christ as the promised David’s Son; and that, owing to the foreknown rejection of the messiah, etc., is postponed to the ending of this age or dispensation. The language of Christ accurately corresponds with our previous propositions, for we have 
>1. (1) “*My Kingdom*", a Kingdom belonging to Jesus as covenanted; 
>2. (2) “*is not of this world*”—it is a Kingdom, as we have already shown, *not* of a human-devised order of arrangement, *not* of earthly derivation, but heaven-derived and belonging to a renewed order of arrangement, in the future, to “*the world to come*,” having been, as prophets and as Jesus himself, previously predicted, postponed; 
>3. (3) “*if My Kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews*” i.e. if it were not of “*the world to come*” if it were not postponed to the end of the age and to a new order of things, *then* would 1 not be in the power of the Jews for then even my servants would fight, but the Kingdom being postponed from the First to the Second Advent, my servants do not interfere with the authority of Caesar; 
>4. (4) “*but now is My Kingdom not from hence*” i.e. but *now, during the present* order of things, owing to this very postponement my Kingdom is not of this world. This itself would forbid the idea of the Church Kingdom, and as the emphasis is on the word “*now*” there is implied *that at some future time*, as our argument demands, His Kingdom would be established. Besides this, the peculiar and significant “*but now*” implies even more, viz., that His Kingdom will ultimately, although not at present, embrace a jurisdiction or dominion over the world, crushing and overcoming all resistance, which corresponds with what is predicted, Rev. II: 15, “the Kingdoms *of this world* are become the Kingdom of our Lord and His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever.” Our view causes *no antagonism* between the two passages, but receives and harmonizes both of them; for, as the prophets describe the Kingdom, it is *not world-derived* but will at a certain period of time manifest itself in the appearing of the King and exhibit a world-dominion.

### Other passages
#### Rom. 14:17
for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
#### Luke 16:16
The Law and the Prophets were until John; since that time the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed, and everyone is forcing his way into it.
#### Matt. 11:11-12
Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen _anyone_ greater than John the Baptist! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force.
#### John 3:3-5
Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” 4 Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?” 5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
### Most direct passage
>It is supposed that the most direct Scripture in support of the Church-Kingdom theory is found in Col. 1:13, “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the Kingdom of His dear Son.” This undoubtedly is the strongest proof text that can be presented in favor of the prevailing view.
>p. 35 Vol. 2 Prop 109 Obs. 3

>... easily reconcilable with the principle that future blessings are spoken of as present, as exemplified in Heb. 12:22, 23, etc. (comp. Prop. 65, Obs. 9).
>p. 35 Vol. 2 Prop 109 Obs. 3

>Commentators (as e.g. Bloomfield, loci) frankly admit this explanation and think that reference is made to the hope of the Kingdom expressed in verse 6. Hence John declares in the most decided manner his strong faith and hope of sharing in the Kingdom.
>p. 36 Vol. 2 Prop 109 Obs. 3

#### Col. 1:13
Who rescued us from the authority of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of the Son of His love,
#### Rev. 1:9
I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance _which are_ in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the witness of Jesus.
#### Acts 14:22
strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and _saying_, “Through many afflictions we must enter the kingdom of God.”

12 And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
13 And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. [For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.’]
