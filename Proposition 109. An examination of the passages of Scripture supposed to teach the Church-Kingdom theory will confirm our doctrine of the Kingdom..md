#### John 18:36
Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I would not be delivered over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not from here.”

>The view that we have all along maintained is this, viz., that this Kingdom, Theocratic-Davidic, is of divine origin and is specially claimed as God’s, He Himself being the Ruler in and through the reigning King; that this Kingdom, being not of worldly but divine outgrowth, is promised to Jesus Christ as the promised David’s Son; and that, owing to the foreknown rejection of the messiah, etc., is postponed to the ending of this age or dispensation. The language of Christ accurately corresponds with our previous propositions, for we have (1) “My Kingdom,M a Kingdom belonging to Jesus as covenanted; (2) “is not of this world”—it is a Kingdom, as we have already shown, not of a human-devised order of arrangement, not of earthly derivation, but heaven-derived and belonging to a renewed order of arrangement, in the future, to “the world to come,” having been, as prophets and as Jesus himself, previously predicted, postponed; (3) “if My Kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews” i.e. if it were not of “the world to come” if it were not postponed to the end of the age and to a new order of things, then would 1 not be in the power of the Jews for then even my servants would fight, but the Kingdom being postponed from the First to the Second Advent, my servants do not interfere with the authority of Caesar; (4) “but now is My Kingdom not from hence” i.e. but now, during the present order of things, owing to this very postponement my Kingdom is not of this world. This itself would forbid the idea of the Church Kingdom, and as the emphasis is on the word “now” there is implied that at some future time, as our argument demands, His Kingdom would be established. Besides this, the peculiar and significant “but now” implies even more, viz., that His Kingdom will ultimately, although not at present, embrace a jurisdiction or dominion over the world, crushing and overcoming all resistance, which corresponds with what is predicted, Rev. II: 15, “the Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdom of our Lord and His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever.” Our view causes no antagonism between the two passages, but receives and harmonizes both of them; for, as the prophets describe the Kingdom, it is not world-derived but will at a certain period of time manifest itself in the appearing of the King and exhibit a world-dominion.
