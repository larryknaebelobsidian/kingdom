>This is distinctly announced in the declarations pertaining *to the period immediately ‘preceding the Advent*. The Church, ‘Instead of developing into that condition of knowledge and faith which so many writers confidently predict, is represented as occupying a position *the very opposite*. Jesus significantly (Luke 18:8) asks: “*When the Son of man cometh shall He find faith* (the faith) *on the earth*?” i.e. will the Church be in such a condition of trial, of testing, that it will fail to exercise faith in the very provision made for deliverance? Faith in a variety of things may indeed be found, but will it believe in and pray for that “*blessed hope*” *which alone can bring in glorious salvation*?
>p. 217 Vol. 3 Prop. 177 

>A *believer* in the Kingdom, as covenanted, predicted, preached, postponed, connected with the Sec. Advent, etc., in the very nature of the case occupies the position of the Primitive Church, and *looks, longs, and prays for the Coming One*.
>p. 217 Vol. 3 Prop. 177 Obs. 1

>The faithlessness of the Church—manifested by a disregard to the speedy Advent, by a lack of interest in, and a positive dislike to, the subject, by an unwarranted substitution of other things (as e.g. death, providence, etc.) in place of the appearing of Jesus Christ, by the interposition of a long definite period between us and the Advent, by decrying the position of watching, study of these things, etc., in others clearly springs from *a total misconception of the nature of the Kingdom* that David’s Son shall establish here on the earth. Engrafting a mystical or spiritualistic interpretation, in place of the grammatical, upon the Scriptures; rejecting the belief of pious Jews and of the early Church as erroneous and unworthy of the enlightenment of this age—a Kingdom is set up which being in existence, of course, does not require the faith once *the distinguishing feature and characteristic* of the saints.
>p. 217-218 Vol. 3 Prop. 177 Obs. 1
