>This is distinctly announced in the declarations pertaining *to the period immediately ‘preceding the Advent*. The Church, ‘Instead of developing into that condition of knowledge and faith which so many writers confidently predict, is represented as occupying a position *the very opposite*. Jesus significantly (Luke 18:8) asks: “*When the Son of man cometh shall He find faith* (the faith) *on the earth*?” i.e. will the Church be in such a condition of trial, of testing, that it will fail to exercise faith in the very provision made for deliverance? Faith in a variety of things may indeed be found, but will it believe in and pray for that “*blessed hope*” *which alone can bring in glorious salvation*?
