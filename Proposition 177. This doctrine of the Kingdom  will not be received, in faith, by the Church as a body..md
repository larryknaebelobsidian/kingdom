# Proposition 177. This doctrine of the Kingdom will not be received, in faith, by the Church as a body.

>This is distinctly announced in the declarations pertaining *to the period immediately ‘preceding the Advent*. The Church, ‘Instead of developing into that condition of knowledge and faith which so many writers confidently predict, is represented as occupying a position *the very opposite*. Jesus significantly (Luke 18:8) asks: “*When the Son of man cometh shall He find faith* (the faith) *on the earth*?” i.e. will the Church be in such a condition of trial, of testing, that it will fail to exercise faith in the very provision made for deliverance? Faith in a variety of things may indeed be found, but will it believe in and pray for that “*blessed hope*” *which alone can bring in glorious salvation*?
>p. 217 Vol. 3 Prop. 177 

>A *believer* in the Kingdom, as covenanted, predicted, preached, postponed, connected with the Sec. Advent, etc., in the very nature of the case occupies the position of the Primitive Church, and *looks, longs, and prays for the Coming One*.
>p. 217 Vol. 3 Prop. 177 Obs. 1

>The faithlessness of the Church—manifested by a disregard to the speedy Advent, by a lack of interest in, and a positive dislike to, the subject, by an unwarranted substitution of other things (as e.g. death, providence, etc.) in place of the appearing of Jesus Christ, by the interposition of a long definite period between us and the Advent, by decrying the position of watching, study of these things, etc., in others clearly springs from *a total misconception of the nature of the Kingdom* that David’s Son shall establish here on the earth. Engrafting a mystical or spiritualistic interpretation, in place of the grammatical, upon the Scriptures; rejecting the belief of pious Jews and of the early Church as erroneous and unworthy of the enlightenment of this age—a Kingdom is set up which being in existence, of course, does not require the faith once *the distinguishing feature and characteristic* of the saints.

### Cause for unbelief - Man's nature to rely on authorities outside the Bible

### Eminent piety, goodness substituted for knowledge
Obs. 6

>... we also urge others to accept of this doctrine, because by so doing they increase their own appreciation of God’s truth, confirm their hope in covenant promises, open the Scriptures to a better understanding, give due prominency to the Sec. Advent, encourage themselves to cultivate the Christian graces to secure an inheritance in the Kingdom, accept it as a motive to patience, mortification, comfort, etc., and place themselves in the commanded position of servants looking, watching, praying, loving, desiring the appearing of the King and Kingdom.
>p. 227-228 Vol. 3 Prop. 177 Obs. 6

>Men tell us that it is not “*the Gospel*,” and that it ought not to be preached *from the pulpit*. Such forget that the Gospel is “*the Gospel of the Kingdom*;” that the early preachers as Philip “*preached the things concerning the Kingdom*;” and that all the Apostles *proclaimed the same*, so that the greatest of them (Paul) said: “*I have gone preaching the Kingdom of God*.” To leave out the Kingdom and substitute the means for obtaining the Kingdom for the Kingdom itself, is *only a small part of “the Gospel*.”
>p. 228 Vol. 3 Prop. 177 Obs. 6

>Ministers tell us, as if it were an ample excuse for neglect, that they are to preach “*Christ and Him crucified*,” and “*win souls to Christ*.” The Apostles did this, and *at the same time* preached “the Kingdom.”
>p. 228 Vol. 3 Prop. 177 Obs. 6

>To preach “Christ” as the prophets and Apostles announced Him *demands a knowledge of this Kingdom* (Prop. 205),
>p. 228 Vol. 3 Prop. 177 Obs. 6

>What must we say then to that large class of professed believers, who establish unbelief in themselves and others by denouncing our doctrine of the Kingdom (under the garb of superior piety, spirituality, etc.), as “*sensual*", "*carnal*,” “*fleshly*," etc. Do they not see that by so doing they not only *caricature* the faith of the early Church at the expense of Christianity, but direct *a deadly blow* at the preaching of the Kingdom as given in the opening of the New Testament by which the knowledge, integrity, etc., of the first preachers, specially and divinely sent forth, are sacrificed?
>p. 229 Vol. 3 Prop. 177 Obs. 7

>Any theory, no matter by whom advocated, that introduces *so fatal an antagonism* between primitive and present faith, is to be discarded as *irreconcilable* with the truth. Bat instead of this, the masses follow such reasoning and the substitutions intended, led by the authority, reputation, etc. of others, and swayed by the reproach cast upon our faith.
