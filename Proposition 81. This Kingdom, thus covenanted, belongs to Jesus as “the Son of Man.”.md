# Proposition 81. This Kingdom, thus covenanted, belongs to Jesus as “the Son of Man.”

>The kingdom, therefore, is pointedly in harmony with covenant and promise, predicted as bestowed upon “the Son of Man,” as e.g. Dan. 7:13.

>The Infinite and the Finite, the God and the Man, the Absolute and the Relative, are united in this the most astonishing of all unions. We dare not separate what God has joined, and we declare, (1) that such a union is perpetual, and (2) that its foundation—overlooked by many writers—is in the Theocratic Plan as purposed (comp. Prop. 199). But while this is so, our argument, in accord with the expressed Divine Purpose, makes much of the human nature and the important part it is yet to take in Redemption.
>Obs. 1

>Obs. 2. Various reasons are assigned by theologians for the use of this phrase “the Son of Man a favorite with Jesus,
>...
>it is the peculiar, distinctive, predicted name of the Messiah given to Him in virtue of His covenanted relationship to the kingdom.
>...
>the Kingdom, when specifically promised, is always promised to the humanity of Jesus, i.e. to Him as “the Son of Man,” and not to His Divine nature, i.e. to Him as “the Son of God.”
>Obs. 2

>Obs. 4. The most fruitful source of misinterpreting this Kingdom arises from not discriminating to whom this Kingdom is specially promised. According to the covenant—and this must necessarily be the basis of a correct Scriptural representation—it is promised to the Son of David, the Son of Man.

>it is not the Divine Sonship that constitutes “the Christ” (although an essential element), and it is not the Davidic Sonship that constitutes Him “the Messiah” (although essentially requisite), but it is the two inseparably united that makes Him “the Christ.”
>Obs. 4

>Obs. 6. “The Son of Man” is fully identified with the re-establishment of the Davidic throne and Kingdom by covenant and promise.

>Obs. 7. Hence at the Sec. Advent there must be, in order to fulfil the oath-bound covenant made with David (viz.: that one “according to the flesh” must be raised up to sit on the restored Theocratic throne), a real, veritable Son of David. The humanity, glorified as it may be, cannot be ignored; it is an essential factor in the Theocratic ordering. Therefore the coming of “the Christ” is represented as the Coming of “the Son of Man,” i.e. a coming in the very humanity assumed under covenanted relationship.

>Obs. 8. The critical reader will not fail to notice that the Incarnation is a covenanted necessity, and that it forms a fundamental part of our system of faith; for without it the fulfilment of covenant promises would be impossible.
