# Proposition 159. This Theocratic Kingdom of the Lord Jesus, the Christ, will never come to an end.

>It is asserted by some (as e.g. Calvin, *Insti.*, B. 3, ch. 25) that our doctrine limits the reign of Christ *only* to the one thousand years. This is incorrect. While some Millenarians explain the “delivering up of the Kingdom” somewhat similar to our opposers, yet even nearly all—if not all—of these, as far as we have any knowledge of their writings, affirm that *Jesus continues to* reign in the same Kingdom, subordinately to the Father, *after* the close of the thousand years. The reasons for *the perpetuity* of the Christ’s Kingdom will now be presented, and the only passage that seems to militate against it will be examined.
>p. 630 Vol. 2 Prop. 159
### Terms used
>Obs. 1. While the words “eternal,” “everlasting,” “forever,” are sometimes employed to denote limited duration (i.e. duration adapted to the nature of the thing of which it is affirmed), yet such words applied to the Kingdom of Jesus Christ *cannot* be thus restricted, because an unending duration intended by them is stated in *explanatory* phraseology (as e.g. Luke 1:32 “*of His Kingdom there shall be no end*,” etc.). The thousand years are *specifically* mentioned as *the period* of Satan’s binding and of the time existing *between* the two resurrections, and of this era it is also asserted that Christ and His saints reign. The declaration of their reigning during this period does *not limit* the reign to it, but is added to indicate that the reign is already commenced and extends through this Millenary age.. Jesus is not merely the king of “*an age*,” but of “*the ages*” (1 Tim. 1:17 Greek), and His Kingdom is united, not merely to “*an age*,” but to “*the age of ages*” or “*eternal ages*,” thus indicating its extension onward through the vast succession of time in unending series. Hence the perpetuity of the Kingdom is freely declared in 2 Sam. 7:16; Heb. 1:8; Luke 1:32, 33; Rev. 11:15; Isa. 9:7; 2 Pet. 1:11, etc., and this is explained, Dan. 2:44, to be “*a Kingdom that shall never be destroyed,*" and in Dan. 7:14, “*His dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and His Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.*”

### Apostles and Prophets
>It is significant that the apostles adopt the Jewish phraseology, speaking of the perpetuity of the Messianic reign and Kingdom, without giving the least intimation of *a change* in meaning.
>p. 632 Vol. 2 Prop. 159 Obs. 2

>The character, person, offices, position, in brief, all pertaining to the Messiah, as David’s Son, *once* obtained by Him are appropriately represented as belonging to Him *evermore*. The inheritance given to Him as David’s Son; the reward bestowed upon Him as such is never given up by Him, or withdrawn from Him.
>p. 632 Vol. 2 Prop. 159 Obs. 2

>it is the Divine purpose evermore to exercise the Rulership of a God over the whole earth in and through the Person, the glorified humanity, of the Lord Jesus and His associated brethren. The honor belonging to *the distinctive Christ* is never lessened or altered.
>p. 633 Vol. 2 Prop. 159 Obs. 2
### Yielding up the kingdom
>Obs. 3. There is only *one passage* in Scripture which is supposed to teach the yielding up or ending of the distinctive Messianic Kingdom, viz., 1 Cor. 15:27, 28.
>p. 634 Vol. 2 Prop. 159 Obs. 3

>Whatever view is engrafted upon or derived from these verses, nearly all (excepting those which utterly degrade Christ, and hence are unworthy of notice) admit, whatever delivering up is intended, that Jesus Christ *still reigns*, either as God, the humanity being subordinate, or God-man deprived of His dominion and occupying a lower station, etc.
