# Proposition 38. John the Baptist preached that this Kingdom, predicted by the Prophets, was “nigh at hand”

>This Kingdom was to be offered to the Jewish nation, and John’s mission was to prepare the nation for its acceptance. However men may explain the Kingdom itself, the fact stated is not disputed.
### Underestimating John the baptist
>Obs. 1. But right here, at the very beginning of the New Test, narrative, pious and good men, under a mistaken view of the Kingdom to which John’s preaching does not correspond, endeavor to lessen the knowledge and the importance of John. This is done by misapplying a passage of Scripture, so that the idea is boldly advanced that John’s teaching, in comparison with what is now taught, is of comparative little value.
### Overestimating John the baptist
>Obs. 2. Others, again, in the way of eulogizing John as a preacher of the coming Kingdom, exalt him beyond what the language and facts will bear.
### A gospel prior to the crucifixion
>Obs. 3. John preached “the gospel of the Kingdom,” just as Jesus, the twelve, and the seventy afterward preached it. Attention is simply directed to this, because some assert that there is no preaching of the Gospel unless a crucified Redeemer is proclaimed. But we have here and previous to the death of Jesus the gospel of the Kingdom proclaimed to the nation.

### Some writers present invalid views
