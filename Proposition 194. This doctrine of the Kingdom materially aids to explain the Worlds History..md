>With a knowledge of this Kingdom, its germ in the Covenant, its divine institution, its withdrawal, its tender and rejection, its postponement, its preparatory stages, and, above all, its final restoration under the Messiah, it is possible to explain the history of the world in a consistent manner.

>Obs. 1. Looking at the end as delineated in Holy Scripture and tracing the provisionary movements which lead to the portrayed result, we may say, in a sense different from Schelling, that “the whole of history is a divine revelation”; because a divine ordering toward a specified end, is manifest in all history.

>in history, as it will be, we have a manifestation of the overruling Divine power by which the completed salvation, the perfected redemption, is fully accomplished.
>Obs. 1


>what great leading (biblical) fact does the Word present for which all others are more or less preparatory. The answer is plain, it is found in this Theocratic Kingdom of the Messiah. But to comprehend this fact, we must not confine ourselves to the past or to the present but also embrace the future, the end contemplated by the Creator just as covenanted and predicted, and then trace back through the several ages the provisionary causes working toward the end designed.
>Obs. 2

>Then the Bible will be found to contain the grand outlines of history, with here and there a particularizing: and history will corroborate the existence of an overruling power pressing toward a fixed, definite, pre-determined goal.
>Obs. 2

>Obs. 3. This Kingdom explains why only the briefest mention is made of Antediluvian history, and such prominency is given to Abraham’s history; why Jewish history becomes such an important factor in the world’s history, and why comparatively so little is said of Gentile nations in their national development.

>Obs. 4. Again, take the fall of man and the personal withdrawal of God. However the historical account may be explained, fact demonstrates the truthfulness of both, viz., that restraining influences are requisite to incline man to virtue and holiness, to moral law and order: and that God is not personally present with man. So long as these facts exist, it is folly to deny them; and unless a better explanation than that given in the Word to account for the introduction of such facts is presented (which has never yet been done), it is both unwise and unsafe to reject the Biblical statement on the subject.

>Hence to take the fall and view it as an isolated fact, briefly expressed, without observing its connection with history, is doing violence to Holy Writ;
>Obs. 4

>While the Bible insists upon the depravity of man, yet at the same time it also states that such is his condition, mental, moral, and physical, that God still deemed him worthy of redemption, and in the determination of such redemption and the provision made for it through Jesus Christ elevated man to a position of dignity which he is now at liberty either to retain, confirm, and enlarge (viz., by the reception of Christ), or to degrade and forever forfeit (viz., through the rejection of proffered salvation).
>Obs. 4

>Obs. 5. This Kingdom throws additional light upon the problem of evil, and if ever a correct Theodicy is formed, it must be based upon the Theocratic ordering as it will ultimately be realized.

>sin and its consequent evils in the world will only be endured until a sufficiency of moral and religious power (in the persons of the elect) is gathered out to insure an overwhelming, triumphant, and perpetual ascendency of a pure Theocratic government over all the earth,
>Obs. 5

>Obs. 6. Much is said respecting progress, and the praises of Perfectibility are loudly proclaimed by rationalistic, naturalistic, and mystical advocates. But the history of the world down to the Second Advent shows that God’s estimate of human nature is the only correct one.

>Then will it clearly appear that this long series of repeated depravity, finally culminating in the Antichrist, was only ‘permitted in order that during this period this distinctive and peculiar people of God, designed for coheirship with Jesus the Christ, might be formed for the Theocratic Kingdom.
>Obs. 6

>Obs. 7. This Kingdom realized, throws light upon the doctrine of atonement and its relationship to the history of the world.

>His death and resurrection are the pledges or evidence, if we will receive them, that the covenants will be most amply realized;
>Obs. 7

>He died for man, for this world, to redeem it, and in this world the Christ, David’s Son, is to reign in the promised Kingdom.
>Obs. 8

>the Bible very pointedly confines itself, almost exclusively, to the history of this world, to the fall, the intermediate period, and the recovery, and has but little to say concerning the Universe so persistently paraded by men.
>Obs. 8
