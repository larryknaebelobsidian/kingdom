## Props Mentioned
[[Proposition 123. The Pre-Millennial Advent and the accompanying Kingdom are united with, the destruction of Antichrist.|123]] [[Proposition 160. This Kingdom is set up in the divided state of the Roman Empire.|160]] 

>It was a generally received opinion of the Jews (comp. Reuss, *His. of Ch. Theol. Ap. Age*, p. 115, etc.) that the Messianic Kingdom could not be introduced without *the previous* manifestation of the Antichrist. This view was derived from Daniel and the other prophets, who described such an Antichristian power—the great enemy portrayed in its outward culminated form—as preceding *the coming of the Son of man* to set up His Kingdom. This belief was incorporated in the early Church, and was universally held as belonging to the period *immediately antecedent* to the open, visible Advent of the Lord Jesus at His Second Coming.
>p. 669 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 2


>The student will here recognize in the prophecies a most wonderful evidence of inspiration in the foreseen rejection of Jesus, the postponement of the Kingdom, and hence in describing the continued Gentile domination passing over the First Advent and linking its overthrow under the culminated Antichrist with the Second Coming—and doing this, too, without specification of the same, lest it interfere with the tender of the Kingdom to the nation.
>p. 669 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 2

>Antichrist, not only oppresses the Church and the Jewish nation, but is actually represented *as triumphant* over both Church and nation,
>p. 669 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 2

>Divine revelation has purposely enshrouded the matter so as not to interfere with the free agency of man in development,
>p. 670 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3

>Like all subjects which are given by the Spirit in a fragmentary form, here something and there something, it can only be properly comprehended by observing *all* the passages relating to it; by confining ourselves (being prophetic, and hence beyond man’s power to portray) closely to the Scriptures; and by drawing conclusions supported by the general analogy of the entire Scriptures.
>p. 670 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3

>in the times of the Reformation the opinion that the Pope was Antichrist *became general and decided* among Protestants.” The student well knows that this very belief materially aided in advancing the Reformation. Indeed, so generally did this opinion advance that we find it finally even inserted as an article of faith in the Confession of the French Reformed Church at the Synod of Gass in 1603, and in the Smalcald Articles (Rechenberg’s Ed. 2, 4, p. 314, and Ap. p. 347.)
>p. 670 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3


>The generality of writers thought that he was revealed (as e.g. in the Papacy, Mohammedanism, Infidelity, etc.), but would finally culminate in one great personal head in whom all the marks, inchoately fulfilled, would be found.
>p. 674 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3

>Others thought that the term Antichrist could not be legitimately given to any but to the one who was still regarded as future,
>p. 674 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3

>“The Fathers were unanimous in their opinion that the Antichrist was to be a person; nor has the Greek Church, which in most respects has maintained the sentiments of the Fathers on this point, ever made a question of it.”
>p. 679 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4

>Comparatively few entertain the idea of a Satanic incarnation, or a resurrected Judas (reviving in another form and person the old resurrected Nero—comp. Stuart, *Apoc*., vol. 2, p. 441—theory, Sulp. Severus saying: “At the close of the age, he is to be sent again that he may exercise the mystery of iniquity”); the large majority inclining to his being *a mere man*, wonderfully endowed, and in whom wickedness shall reach its consummation (some incorporating in a measure Theodoret’s or Chrysostom’s idea that he shall be under the special energy of the devil and exhibit therefore Satanic might).
>p. 680 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4

Some think that the Antichrist will come from the tribe of Dan. - Obs. 4 notes

Peters discusses reasons why Satan cannot be the Antichrist, or a direct offspring of Satan - Obs. 4 notes

>Whether he is to be expected personally, as one individual embodiment  of evil, we would not dogmatically pronounce; still we would not forget that both ancient and historical interpretation points this way.
>p. 682 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4 note 2


>Another feature in the discussion of the past, and *fruitful of mistake* (even in otherwise very able writers), is *the indiscriminate application* of all predictions relating to antichristian powers to this one Antichrist.
>p. 683 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5


>The whore is not the Antichrist, since she comes to her doom when this Antichrist is at the height of his power,
>p. 684 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5

>The prediction of Dan. most certainly impresses the reader with the idea that this horn exists down to the coming of the Ancient of Days, to the personal Advent itself, *thus corresponding*—whatever inchoate fulfilment may be attributed to it—*with the Antichrist destroyed at Christ’s Sec. Advent and not with the whore previously previously destroyed by the Beast and ten horns*.
