# Proposition 161. This Kingdom will not be re-established until after Antichrist is overthrown.
### Props Mentioned

>It was a generally received opinion of the Jews (comp. Reuss, *His. of Ch. Theol. Ap. Age*, p. 115, etc.) that the Messianic Kingdom could not be introduced without *the previous* manifestation of the Antichrist. This view was derived from Daniel and the other prophets, who described such an Antichristian power—the great enemy portrayed in its outward culminated form—as preceding *the coming of the Son of man* to set up His Kingdom. This belief was incorporated in the early Church, and was universally held as belonging to the period *immediately antecedent* to the open, visible Advent of the Lord Jesus at His Second Coming.
>p. 669 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 2


>The student will here recognize in the prophecies a most wonderful evidence of inspiration in the foreseen rejection of Jesus, the postponement of the Kingdom, and hence in describing the continued Gentile domination passing over the First Advent and linking its overthrow under the culminated Antichrist with the Second Coming—and doing this, too, without specification of the same, lest it interfere with the tender of the Kingdom to the nation.
>p. 669 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 2

### Triumphant over Church and Jewish Nation
>Antichrist, not only oppresses the Church and the Jewish nation, but is actually represented *as triumphant* over both Church and nation,
>p. 669 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 2

### Purposeful Shrouding
>Divine revelation has purposely enshrouded the matter so as not to interfere with the free agency of man in development,
>p. 670 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3

>Like all subjects which are given by the Spirit in a fragmentary form, here something and there something, it can only be properly comprehended by observing *all* the passages relating to it; by confining ourselves (being prophetic, and hence beyond man’s power to portray) closely to the Scriptures; and by drawing conclusions supported by the general analogy of the entire Scriptures.
>p. 670 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3

>... in the times of the Reformation the opinion that the Pope was Antichrist *became general and decided* among Protestants.” The student well knows that this very belief materially aided in advancing the Reformation. Indeed, so generally did this opinion advance that we find it finally even inserted as an article of faith in the Confession of the French Reformed Church at the Synod of Gass in 1603, and in the Smalcald Articles (Rechenberg’s Ed. 2, 4, p. 314, and Ap. p. 347.)
>p. 672 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3 Item 3

>The generality of writers thought that he was revealed (as e.g. in the Papacy, Mohammedanism, Infidelity, etc.), but would finally culminate in one great personal head in whom all the marks, inchoately fulfilled, would be found.
>p. 674 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3 Item 6

>Others thought that the term Antichrist could not be legitimately given to any but to the one who was still regarded as future,
>p. 674 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3 Item 6

### A Person
>“The Fathers were *unanimous* in their opinion that the Antichrist was to be *a person*; nor has the Greek Church, which in most respects has maintained the sentiments of the Fathers on this point, ever made a question of it.”
>-- Brooks (*El. of Proph. Interp.*, p. 257)
>p. 679 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4

>Comparatively few entertain the idea of a Satanic incarnation, or a resurrected Judas (reviving in another form and person the old resurrected Nero—comp. Stuart, *Apoc*., vol. 2, p. 441—theory, Sulp. Severus saying: “At the close of the age, he is to be sent again that he may exercise the mystery of iniquity”); the large majority inclining to his being *a mere man*, wonderfully endowed, and in whom wickedness shall reach its consummation (some incorporating in a measure Theodoret’s or Chrysostom’s idea that he shall be under the special energy of the devil and exhibit therefore Satanic might).
>p. 680 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4

### From Tribe of Dan?
Some think that the Antichrist will come from the tribe of Dan.  
p. 680-681 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4 note 1

>Turner (*His. of the Anglo-Saxons*, vol. 2, p. 477, etc.), gives a summary of Acuins's (Aquinas'?) views respecting the Antichrist: "He is to be born of a most flagitious robber and harlot, with the aid of the devil, at Babylon.  He will pervade Palestine; convert kings, princes, and people; and send his missionaries all over the world. He will work many miracles; bring fire from heaven; make trees vegetate in a moment; calm and agitate the sea at his will; transform various objects; change the course of rivers; command the winds; and apparently raise the dead.  He will bitterly persecute Christianity.  He will discover hidden treasures and lavish them among his followers; a dreadful period of tribulation will follow."
>p. 681 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4 note 1

>Whether he is to be expected personally, as one individual embodiment  of evil, we would not dogmatically pronounce; still we would not forget that both ancient and historical interpretation points this way.
>p. 682 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4 note 2


>Another feature in the discussion of the past, and *fruitful of mistake* (even in otherwise very able writers), is *the indiscriminate application* of all predictions relating to antichristian powers to this one Antichrist.
>p. 683 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5


>The whore is *not* the Antichrist, since she comes to her doom when this Antichrist is at the height of his power,  ...
>p. 684 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5

>The prediction of Dan. most certainly impresses the reader with the idea that this horn exists down *to* the coming of the Ancient of Days, *to* the personal Advent itself, *thus corresponding*—whatever inchoate fulfilment may be attributed to it—*with the Antichrist destroyed at Christ’s Sec. Advent and not with the whore previously previously destroyed by the Beast and ten horns*.
>p. 684 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5

>That class of interpreters who make the first beast of Rev. 13, the Antichrist, in its last head, are to be commended as correct, when this made aside or separate from the Papacy.
>p. 687 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5 note 2

>... the Antichrist is the last, culminated head of the First Beast of Rev. 13 and 17, the same that is destroyed *by* the personal Second Advent of Jesus, and *after* he has desolated and burned the harlot, simple consistency demands us to consider -- aside from other reasons -- that the Antichrist of Dan. 7 and of 2 Thess. 2, which meets with the identical fate, is likewise the same, and cannot be applied to the great Apostasy or Papacy.
>p. 687 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5 note 2

>... Antiochus Epiphanes, who is a type -- thus to be understood -- of the coming Antichrist.
>p. 688 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5 note 4

>... “the falling away is *by no means identical* with the Antichrist (as the Fathers understood it), or even merely (as De Wette thinks) the working exclusively of Antichrist; rather, the general rush of violent departure from the faith *precedes* that final disclosure of the Antichristian despot.” The most careful writers thus discriminate *between* the apostasy itself and the Antichrist which is developed from or arises out of it; the former being regarded as introductory, the latter as its ripened fruit.
>p. 689 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 6

>The apostasy is *not confined* simply to one person, one party or sect, but may embrace many persons and various systems under the one general term.
>p. 690 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 6

>Notice the marks or characteristics given to this Antichrist.
>. . .
>a denier of Jesus, the Christ, and the Father who sent Him.
>p. 698 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 10 

### When Revealed
>When shall this Antichrist be revealed?
>. . .
>And notice that in Rev. 14, the time of His gigantic power, cruel persecution and worship *follows* 
>1. the resurrection and translation of the chosen 144,000, 
>2. the renewed proclamation of God’s predictions and 
>3. the fall of the Papal power (and State churches, etc). Antichrist, therefore, however developed previously,  
>4. *succeeds the first stage* (Props. 130, 166, 174) of the Sec. Advent and the removal of a select body of saints, and 
>5. flourishes in all his might, fierceness, and self-deification *between the two stages* of the Sec. Advent.
> p. 700 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 11 reformatted

### Restrainer
>Before the Antichrist is revealed *something which hinders or prevents* (2 Thess. 2:6, 7) his manifestation must be removed.
>. . .
>After carefully considering the views hitherto given and the fact, stated in the previous Obs., that the chosen, elect number of saints (symbolized by the 144,000) are first removed, taken away before the revelation of Antichrist occurs, we find no better interpretation for this difficult passage than that suggestive one of Theodoret and Theodore of Mopsuestia (Smith’s *Bib. Dic.*, “Antichrist”), which gives *a clew to a consistent one sustained by fact*. It suggests (from their making that which withholdeth *the determination, purpose, decree of God*) that *the Divine Purpose* of God, relating to the number of these elect, chosen ones, must first be fulfilled (thus meeting the neuter form), and that *this elect-body* must be removed; He who restrains (the Divine Purposer), or the election (thus represented and considered in its corporate capacity) hindering *until the predetermined number* is completed and taken away—the masculine form being met by an allusion to Him who, by His Purpose in this direction, restrains the coming of Antichrist, or by a reference to the election itself resulting from the Purpose of God, keeping back this mighty evil until its removal as predicted.
>p. 701 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 12

>Attention is called again to this point to indicate that this Antichrist is *a civil head, the absolute ruler over a vast government, the Imperial Lord* over an extended Empire which embraces in it subordinated but too willing civil agents.
>p. 712 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 14
### Virtual Eighth Head of the Beast 
>... *the Antichrist, the virtual eighth head of the beast*.
>p. 716 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 16
### Previous preparation for Anti-christ
>It is evident that such a powerful and wicked personage can never arise and gain the ascendency over the nations as predicted, unless there is *a previous preparation* for him.
>p. 720 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>... the Advent (in its first stage, Prop. 130) may occur at any time, ...
>p. 720 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>... we ought to see tendencies leading toward the recognition of such an antichristian power, a drifting of the nations into such a state of unbelief that the way is gradually but surely *preparing* for this monster manifestation. 
>p. 720 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17
 
>... a *monarchy* more arrogant, far-reaching, encroaching, and tyrannical than the world has ever yet witnessed.
>p. 720 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>... the self-relying efforts of man to exalt humanity will result in his degradation—a degradation, too, so debasing that it falls down to *the worship of man* in the person of Antichrist—that it even stoops to *image worship* enforced by the death penalty, and that it imbrues its hands *in the blood* of a vast number of martyrs.
>p. 720 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>... men, in foolishness and wantonness, will reject the idea of a personal God—a God who has the claims of a Creator and Redeemer.
>p. 720 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>Is it not a sad fact, that literally *masses* among the nations, *led on by intelligence and learning*, are already discarding the God of the Bible as one who has no existence and to whom, therefore, no man is responsible.
>p. 721 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>Dr. Auberlen has well remarked that one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Antichrist is “*intellectual culture*.”
>p. 721 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>... led by the insidious doctrine of natural development (the direct opposite of the Bib. doctrine) and by the removal of the restraints imposed by faith in Holy Writ, *to honor and worship man himself* as the highest embodiment of law and order; and the result is, that they impose upon themselves *the most tyrannical and cruel tyrant* that ever yet trod the earth.
>p. 721 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>The representations of Antichrist are fearfully dark— "*the godless, self-deifying ruler of worldly Empire,*” the Restorer of *a worse abomination* than the ancient emperor worship, the instigator and propagator of *the most seducing, blasphemous, and persecuting falsehoods*—but they are sustained, not merely by their being God’s faithful and true portraitures, but by the appalling facts already presented in the dark history of the preceding and preparative apostatizing from the truth which teaches us that *when* man is cut loose from the Gospel truth, and *follows* his own imaginings, there is *no iniquity and no crime too great* which he is not ready to commit. *The threats* already uttered against Christianity by representatives of large classes of men; *the hatred* with which the Bible and its doctrines are received; *the fanatical* following of reason when its deductions are palpably founded upon unproven premises; *the laudation and glorification* of humanely concocted schemes for the amelioration and exaltation of the race; *the widening denial* that the world needs Divine interposition and a Divine Redeemer; *the elevation* of Materialism, Naturalism, Spiritualism, Humanitarianism into the commanding posture of promising Redemption; *the sure and steady breaking down* of the religious barriers by the interposition and substitution of natural law and the consequent increase of laxity of morals—these are just the indications that we ought to see, if Antichrist’s approach draws nigh. It is *folly* to deny these things or to lessen the value of their warning.
>p. 721-722 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>... the Jews, too, are to be prepared by an adherence to “the new religion of Humanity, ...
>p. 722 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>Antichrist is *the last step* in the development of Satanic influence and power in and through man, and we are assured that this last phase shall be specially pervaded by his energy in order to resist the incoming Messianic Kingdom. *Amazing climax!* so astonishing is it, that (Rev. 13:3 and 17:8) “*all the world wondered after the beast*,” excepting only those who are believing and wise.
>p. 723 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 17

>The worship of Antichrist evidences that man, however atheistic some of his utterances are, cannot divest himself of some conception of religion, the necessity of worship, and the superiority of some being. For, constituted by the mercy and love of the Creator *a religious being*, he cannot, as Luthardt justly “observes in his *Apolog. Lectures*, “get rid of the idea:" because a belief in something higher than his individual self naturally arises from his moral constitution.
>p. 725 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 18
### Man must have a God
>*Man must have a God*. If he rejects the true God, *he must make a God for himself*, and this is of necessity a false one. 
>p. 725 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 18
