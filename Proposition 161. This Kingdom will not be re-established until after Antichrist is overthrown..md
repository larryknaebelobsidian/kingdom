>It was a generally received opinion of the Jews (comp. Reuss, *His. of Ch. Theol. Ap. Age*, p. 115, etc.) that the Messianic Kingdom could not be introduced without *the previous* manifestation of the Antichrist. This view was derived from Daniel and the other prophets, who described such an Antichristian power—the great enemy portrayed in its outward culminated form—as preceding *the coming of the Son of man* to set up His Kingdom. This belief was incorporated in the early Church, and was universally held as belonging to the period *immediately antecedent* to the open, visible Advent of the Lord Jesus at His Second Coming.
>p. 669 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 2


>The student will here recognize in the prophecies a most wonderful evidence of inspiration in the foreseen rejection of Jesus, the postponement of the Kingdom, and hence in describing the continued Gentile domination passing over the First Advent and linking its overthrow under the culminated Antichrist with the Second Coming—and doing this, too, without specification of the same, lest it interfere with the tender of the Kingdom to the nation.
>p. 669 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 2

>Antichrist, not only oppresses the Church and the Jewish nation, but is actually represented *as triumphant* over both Church and nation,
>p. 669 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 2

>Divine revelation has purposely enshrouded the matter so as not to interfere with the free agency of man in development,
>p. 670 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3

>Like all subjects which are given by the Spirit in a fragmentary form, here something and there something, it can only be properly comprehended by observing *all* the passages relating to it; by confining ourselves (being prophetic, and hence beyond man’s power to portray) closely to the Scriptures; and by drawing conclusions supported by the general analogy of the entire Scriptures.
>p. 670 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3

>in the times of the Reformation the opinion that the Pope was Antichrist *became general and decided* among Protestants.” The student well knows that this very belief materially aided in advancing the Reformation. Indeed, so generally did this opinion advance that we find it finally even inserted as an article of faith in the Confession of the French Reformed Church at the Synod of Gass in 1603, and in the Smalcald Articles (Rechenberg’s Ed. 2, 4, p. 314, and Ap. p. 347.)
>p. 670 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3


>The generality of writers thought that he was revealed (as e.g. in the Papacy, Mohammedanism, Infidelity, etc.), but would finally culminate in one great personal head in whom all the marks, inchoately fulfilled, would be found.
>p. 674 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3

>Others thought that the term Antichrist could not be legitimately given to any but to the one who was still regarded as future,
>p. 674 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 3

>“The Fathers were unanimous in their opinion that the Antichrist was to be a person; nor has the Greek Church, which in most respects has maintained the sentiments of the Fathers on this point, ever made a question of it.”
>p. 679 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4

>Comparatively few entertain the idea of a Satanic incarnation, or a resurrected Judas (reviving in another form and person the old resurrected Nero—comp. Stuart, *Apoc*., vol. 2, p. 441—theory, Sulp. Severus saying: “At the close of the age, he is to be sent again that he may exercise the mystery of iniquity”); the large majority inclining to his being *a mere man*, wonderfully endowed, and in whom wickedness shall reach its consummation (some incorporating in a measure Theodoret’s or Chrysostom’s idea that he shall be under the special energy of the devil and exhibit therefore Satanic might).
>p. 680 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4

Some think that the Antichrist will come from the tribe of Dan. - Obs. 4 notes

>Turner (*His. of the Anglo-Saxons*, vol. 2, p. 477, etc.), gives a summary of Acuins's (Aquinas'?) views respecting the Antichrist: "He is to be born of a most flagitious robber and harlot, with the aid of the devil, at Babylon.  He will pervade Palestine; convert kings, princes, and people; and send his missionaries all over the world. He will work many miracles; bring fire from heaven; make trees vegetate in a moment; calm and agitate the sea at his will; transform various objects; change the course of rivers; command the winds; and apparently raise the dead.  He will bitterly persecute Christianity.  He will discover hidden treasures and lavish them among his followers; a dreadful period of tribulation will follow."
>p. 681 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4 note 1

Peters discusses reasons why Satan cannot be the Antichrist, or a direct offspring of Satan - Obs. 4 notes

Man of Sin
son of perdition
the wicked one
the prince that shall come

>Whether he is to be expected personally, as one individual embodiment  of evil, we would not dogmatically pronounce; still we would not forget that both ancient and historical interpretation points this way.
>p. 682 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 4 note 2


>Another feature in the discussion of the past, and *fruitful of mistake* (even in otherwise very able writers), is *the indiscriminate application* of all predictions relating to antichristian powers to this one Antichrist.
>p. 683 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5


>The whore is not the Antichrist, since she comes to her doom when this Antichrist is at the height of his power,
>p. 684 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5

>The prediction of Dan. most certainly impresses the reader with the idea that this horn exists down to the coming of the Ancient of Days, to the personal Advent itself, *thus corresponding*—whatever inchoate fulfilment may be attributed to it—*with the Antichrist destroyed at Christ’s Sec. Advent and not with the whore previously previously destroyed by the Beast and ten horns*.
>p. 684 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5

>That class of interpreters who make the first beast of Rev. 13, the Antichrist, in its last head, are to be commended as correct, when this made aside or separate from the Papacy.
>p. 687 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5 note 2

>the Antichrist is the last, culminated head of the First Beast of Rev. 13 and 17, the same that is destroyed *by* the personal Second Advent of Jesus, and *after* he has desolated and burned the harlot, simple consistency demands us to consider -- aside from other reasons -- that the Antichrist of Dan. 7 and of 2 Thess. 2, which meets with the identical fate, is likewise the same, and cannot be applied to the great Apostasy or Papacy.
>p. 687 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5 note 2


>Antiochus Epiphanes, who is a type -- thus to be understood -- of the coming Antichrist
>p. 688 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 5 note 4

>“the falling away is *by no means identical* with the Antichrist (as the Fathers understood it), or even merely (as De Wette thinks) the working exclusively of Antichrist; rather, the general rush of violent departure from the faith *precedes* that final disclosure of the Antichristian despot.” The most careful writers thus discriminate *between* the apostasy itself and the Antichrist which is developed from or arises out of it; the former being regarded as introductory, the latter as its ripened fruit.
>p. 689 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 6

>The apostasy is *not confined* simply to one person, one party or sect, but may embrace many persons and various systems under the one general term.
>p. 690 Vol. 2 Prop. 161 Obs. 6
