Proposition 94. The overlooking of the [[postponement]] of this Kingdom is a fundamental mistake, and a fruitful source of error in many systems of Theology.
#toc

>Obs. 1. This doctrine, noticed by, and influencing the faith and hope of the Primitive Church, is now, under spiritualizing and mystical ascendency, passed by

>One of the most radical defects in modern theology is found on this point, and, so long as persevered in, certain avenues of knowledge are closed; mystical interpretation; vain attempts to conciliate the Divine utterances with prevailing theories of church and state; labored, unavailing efforts to trace a methodical progress in the teaching of the Saviour and disciples; spiritualistic applications which effectually degrade the ancient faith of the church; the overshadowing and ignoring of highly important truth—these and other evils attend such a position.
>Obs. 2

>Obs. 3. The rejection of the postponement of the Kingdom, is a rejection of the only key that can unlock the singular and otherwise mysterious sayings of Jesus. The consistency of the Divine narration of Christ’s life, and of the faith and conduct of His disciples before and after His death, is alone preserved by its adoption.

>the idea of the postponement of the Kingdom had a most powerful influence, for at least three centuries, in moulding the doctrinal views of the church.
>Obs. 4

>could not come unless Jesus went away. This was necessary, because the sinfulness of the nation had postponed the predicted promised Coming of the Spirit with the Kingdom (comp. Prop. 170),
>Obs. 5

>The Jews, abiding by the plain statements of the Old Test., survey the various prevailing theories, advanced respecting a present existing Messianic Kingdom, and finding them one and all antagonistic to the covenanted and predicted promises, reject Christianity itself,—as if this humanly interpolated view was a part of Christianity (which it was not for the first three centuries). Compare Prop. 193.
>Obs. 6

>Obs. 8. The most amiable piety, as well as the grossest unbelief, is alike arrayed against an acknowledgment of this postponement, owing to the pervading influence of the church-Kingdom theories.

>To fully know what His mission was, and how it will be eventually realized, we must refer not merely to His life, to the preaching and testimony of His disciples, but also to what the Prophets have written, ever remembering that the covenants form the basis of all pertaining to the Kingdom. From these united, the doctrine of the Kingdom can be clearly adduced.
>Obs. 10


>Obs. 11. By this postponement the special Davidic covenant remains unfulfilled (excepting that David’s Son and Lord is born, and qualified for the immortal reign), and “the tabernacle of David” continues “fallen down” and “in ruins”—"The house” remains “desolate.”
