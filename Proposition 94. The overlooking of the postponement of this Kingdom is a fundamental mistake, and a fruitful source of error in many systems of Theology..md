Proposition 94. The overlooking of the [postponement](postponement) of this Kingdom is a fundamental mistake, and a fruitful source of error in many systems of Theology.

### Spiritualizing and mystical influence
>Obs. 1. This doctrine, noticed by, and influencing the faith and hope of the Primitive Church, is now, under spiritualizing and mystical ascendency, passed by ...
>p. 621 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 1
### One of the most radical defects in modern theology
>One of *the most radical defects* in modern theology is found on this point, and, so long as persevered in, certain avenues of knowledge are closed; mystical interpretation; vain attempts to conciliate the Divine utterances with prevailing theories of church and state; labored, unavailing efforts to trace a methodical progress in the teaching of the Saviour and disciples; spiritualistic applications which effectually degrade the ancient faith of the church; the overshadowing and ignoring of highly important truth—these and other evils attend such a position.
>p. 622 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 2
### Key to unlocking many scriptures
>Obs. 3. The rejection of the postponement of the Kingdom, is a rejection of *the only key* that can unlock the singular and otherwise mysterious sayings of Jesus. The consistency of the Divine narration of Christ’s life, and of the faith and conduct of His disciples before and after His death, *is alone preserved by its adoption*.
>p. 622-623 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 3
### Powerful influence for three centuries
>... the idea of the postponement of the Kingdom had a most powerful influence, for at least three centuries, *in moulding the doctrinal views* of the church.
>p. 624 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 4
### Could not come unless Jesus went away
>... could not come unless Jesus went away. This was necessary, because the sinfulness of the nation had postponed the predicted promised Coming of the Spirit with the Kingdom (comp. Prop. 170), ...
>p. 624 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 5
### Jews held to no kingdom established yet
>The Jews, abiding by the plain statements of the Old Test., survey the various prevailing theories, advanced respecting a *present existing* Messianic Kingdom, and finding them one and all *antagonistic* to the covenanted and predicted promises, reject Christianity itself,—as if this *humanly interpolated* view was a part of Christianity (which it was not for the first three centuries). Compare Prop. 193.
>p. 625 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 6
### Pervading influence of Church-Kingdom theories
>Obs. 8. The most amiable piety, as well as the grossest unbelief, is alike arrayed against an acknowledgment of this postponement, owing to *the pervading influence* of the church-Kingdom theories.
>p. 626 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 8
### Must include the OT prophets
>To fully know what His mission was, and how it will be eventually realized, we must refer not merely to His life, to the preaching and testimony of His disciples, but also to what the Prophets have written, ever remembering that the covenants form *the basis* of all pertaining to the Kingdom. From these united, the doctrine of the Kingdom can be clearly adduced.
>p. 627 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 10
### David covenant remains unfulfilled
>Obs. 11. By this postponement the special Davidic covenant remains unfulfilled (excepting that David’s Son and Lord is born, and qualified for the immortal reign), and *“the tabernacle of David” continues “fallen down” and “in ruins”—"The house” remains “desolate.”*
>p. 627 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 11
### Evidence of the postponement
>Obs. 12. The evidence in behalf of this postponement has already been given (e.g. Prop 58, 65, 66, 67, 70, etc.), but it may be instructive to notice *how* the passages affording it are treated by many.
>p. 628 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 12
### Postponement announced in Isa. 49, Micah 5, Zech. 13
>Obs. 13. To Millenarians it may be observed, that a remarkable announcement of the postponement of this Kingdom, its ultimate establishment in the restoration of the tribes of Israel with the glory that shall follow, is found in Isa. 49:1-23 (Comp. Alexander’s version), in Micah 5:2, 3, 4 (“*give them up until*” etc.), in Zech. 13:7-9, etc.
>p. 629 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 13
### Very large Judaistic element yet to be fulfilled
>Obs. 16. The postponement indicates that a very large Judaistic element remains yet to be realized in fulfilment.
>p. 630 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 16
### Attempt to disunify the Gospels
>Obs. 17. This view also shows how ungrounded is the insidious (and to the philosophic mind, fascinating) theory, so prevalent, of distinguishing between the Gospels, making them different types or stages of expression. The simple fact is (comp. Prop. 9 and 10), that the Gospels are a unit in representing the leading subject of the Kingdom and of the King, and all of them have the same Jewish covenanted position presented.
>p. 630 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 17
### Effects of unbelief
>Obs. 18. Unbelief,—rejecting the Messianic position, its rejection by the nation and the resultant postponement,—endeavors to deteriorate the actions of Jesus by ascribing to mere human passion what evidently was caused by *the legitimacy* of His station and His *treatment* by the nation.
>p. 630 Vol. 1 Prop. 94 Obs. 18
