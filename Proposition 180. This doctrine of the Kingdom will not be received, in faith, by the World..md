# Proposition 180. This doctrine of the Kingdom will not be received, in faith, by the World.
### The Gospel condemns
>... “*this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved,*” John 3:19, 20. Here a masterly hand in a few sentences lays bare *the leading cause* of opposition to the Bible. The condemnatory nature of both law and Gospel, the requirements of the Bible from the individual, the humbling doctrines associated with Redemption—alas, these form *the great stumbling-blocks* to the Christian religion.
>p. 279 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 1
### High moral requirements
>Therefore it is, that this doctrine of the Kingdom will find *no favor*, not because of the Theocratic order assigned, or the blessings included in it, or the glory of the reign predicted, etc., but because of *the moral fitness moral requirements, the believing Christian life* that is so imperatively, so authoritatively demanded by God before it can be inherited by us. The life of faith required before entrance into it, is not a life of *blind* faith, but of seeing faith, of *appropriating* faith, of faith *resulting in corresponding action*; and such a faith being *unpalatable* to man, forms *the secret spring* of opposition.
>p. 285-286 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 3

### Christianity rests on both reason and faith
>The Word of God introduces *both reason and faith as essential to a true Christian life, to a correct reception of the truth*.
>p. 286 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 4

>Theoretically, i.e. in its doctrinal aspect, it depends on reason, and hence we are urged to use *reason*; practically, i.e. personal experience of the power of truth, it depends on *faith*, and faith is enforced.
>p. 286 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 4

>The application of the laws of language, the comparing of Scripture with Scripture, the criticism of the text, the study of analogy, etc., are all evidences of the intellectual inseparably connected with faith, fostering and cherishing faith, and assigning reasons for the faith within us.
>p. 287 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 4

>... the truth thus refused—*owing to his capacity to understand it*—shall judge him in the last day. While reason is not the rule of faith (as shown by numerous writers, e.g. Prof. Loy, *Evang. Quart. Review*, Jan., 1871), it is also true that faith is not the rule of reason; for they are *sisters, going hand in hand and mutually supporting each other*, making the Word of God *alone the rule, the guide*, as received by them.
>p. 287 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 4

>As Pascal said: “the last step of reason is to know that there is an infinitude of things which surpass it.”
>p. 287 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 4

>... when we say that this Kingdom of God is a subject of faith, that it can only in its entirety be received by faith, we do not at the same time discard reason. The meaning simply is that it is a matter exclusively of Divine Revelation, Procedure, and Consummation. Man could not plan, reveal, prepare for, and finally establish it.
>p. 288 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 4

>*There is nothing so sad under the sun as intelligence fettered by unbelief, as reason bound by pride, as the intellectual nature held irresponsive to the moral, as man attempting to stand alone without the counsel and aid of his Maker.*
>p. 289 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 4

### The charge of credulity against believers
>... the charge of “credulity” brought against believers.
>p. 291 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 5

>... our position advances *the most positive proof* in its support by appealing *to facts* in the past and present; *facts* existing in the nature of man and of truth; *facts* appertaining to a developing Divine Purpose which in its totality, design, progress, etc., evince the intelligent guidance and control of a Creator; *facts* which when united the one to the other form a connected chain of Divine Procedure in the attainment of a definite specified Plan; *facts* too, which any one can verify by personal application of the truth; and *facts* which appertain both to reason and experience— thus manifesting the reasonableness of the same.
>p. 291 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 5

>Dr. Dawson (before Evang. Alliance of 1873) expressed this fully: “When you talk of Darwinism you talk of theories that make *vaster demands on our faith* than on our science.”
>p. 291 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 5

>The condition of the world as delineated in the Word just previous to the Second Advent presents to us the nations under the influence of an unbelieving Naturalism and self-glorified Humanity, arrayed in open hostility to the Lord Jesus Christ.
>Obs. 5
### Weak faith
>Obs. 6. No faith, aside from other reasons, will be exercised in this Kingdom because of *the manner* of its introduction through Supernatural intervention, and of *the Personage* Jesus Christ, through whom it is to be accomplished.
>p. 295 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 6

>To the student of the Word who carefully notices *how* this Kingdom is to be re-established at the close of the times of the Gentiles, it is significant and startling to find that, *in strict correspondence with prediction*, the greatest efforts are *now made* by the Gentiles to decry the Supernatural, to cast out the miraculous, and to bring Jesus to the level of erring, weak, fate-bound humanity. Denying the power and authority of the appointed King, as a matter of course the Kingdom is also rejected, virtually saying, “*We will not have this man to reign over us*.”
>p. 295 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 6

>Christianity, in the controversies raging, has suffered by incorporating principles indefensible (unknown to the early Church), and by endeavoring to defend much that is utterly untenable; unbelief, only too glad to seize upon such indications of weakness, has taken advantage of the incautious and unscriptural attitude assumed, and has pressed the prevailing Theology with a line of argument that, taking the naked Scripture, *is wholly unanswerable* and but *feebly met* by those who reject the early Church doctrine of the Kingdom.
>p. 297 Vol. 3 Prop 180 Obs. 6
