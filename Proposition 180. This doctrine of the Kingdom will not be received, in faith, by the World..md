>“this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved,” John 3:19, 20. Here a masterly hand in a few sentences lays bare the leading cause of opposition to the Bible. The condemnatory nature of both law and Gospel, the requirements of the Bible from the individual, the humbling doctrines associated with Redemption—alas, these form the great stumbling-blocks to the Christian religion.
>Obs. 1
