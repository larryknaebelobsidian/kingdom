## Nations
Who comprise the "nations" in the 1000 years?

Who comprise the "nations" in the eternal state?

## Translation / Resurrection

What is the relationship between resurrection and Peters' translation?

Are there more than two resurrections per Peters? If so, how many?

Is Peters' "translation" the same as the rapture?

Is there more than one rapture per Peters ("translation" of living saints - this is the word used by Peters)? If so, how many?

Who gets translated and when? (this seems to be related to rewards ([[Proposition 135. The doctrine of the Kingdom in full accord with the Scriptural doctrine of the judgment of believers,.|Prop. 135]]) for the faithful) 

Prop. 149 - Peters says the conflageration comes BEFORE the millenium.  How does this agree with Revelation 21 (AFTER) Revelation 20?
