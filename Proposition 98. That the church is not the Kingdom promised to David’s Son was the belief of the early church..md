>So little, indeed, did the first Christians hold the notion that the church is the Kingdom, that they refused even to allow the saints after death to have ascended into the third heaven (see Brooks’ *El. Proph. Inter*., Bickersteth’s *Guide*, etc.), and be in the enjoyment of it, placing them in an intermediate state, awaiting in Hades the coming of the Kingdom (so, e.g., Justin Martyr explicitly declares).

>Let the reader *refer* e.g. to Prop. 93, Obs. 10, and observe how Tertullian explains the Lord's Prayer.  "Thy Kingdom come" cannot be prayed for by those who already possess it.
