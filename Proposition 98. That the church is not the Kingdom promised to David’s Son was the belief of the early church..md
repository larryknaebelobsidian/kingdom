>This has already been distinctly shown under Props. 69-75, but some additional remarks to enforce the same can be readily given.
### No passage found
>Obs. 1. If the church is the predicted Kingdom of God, we certainly ought to find some direct passage teaching this, either in the writings of the Apostles or their immediate successors. But such an one cannot be found.
>...
>A whole nation under a mistake respecting the Messiah’s Kingdom which the Apostles were specially commissioned to preach; and yet an error so fundamental is not directly corrected, but must be inferred or implied! Is it reasonable or credible? The truth is, that no such repudiation of error was needed.
### Expected Nearness of the Advent
>Obs. 2. At the risk of repetition, it may again be said, that the declarations of the Apostles concerning the nearness of the Advent (Prop. 74) prevented them from entertaining the view that the church is the promised Kingdom of Christ.
### Paul's Message to the Thessalonians
>Obs. 3. The strongest possible argument that the Apostle Paul could have used to convince the Thessalonians that they were mistaken as to the imminency of the Advent, would have been the modern one concerning the church, i.e. that Christ’s Kingdom was established in the church, and that according to Daniel and the prophets a long career of honor and dominion was before it, for it would be folly to suppose that a Kingdom just newly set up should so speedily come to an end without fulfilling the prophecies. Let the student reflect on the situation, on the abundant predictions concerning the Kingdom, and then let him consider that if the church was really intended to meet the prophecies of the Kingdom, surely such an appeal, so simple, consistent, and convincing, would have been spoken. Inspiration, however, to be consonant with itself, could not thus give it. Instead of designating the church a Kingdom they (the Apostles) teach that it is a probationary and preparatory stage to the Kingdom.

### Example of a bad philosophy
Obs. 4
### Saint's after death do not go into the third heaven
>So little, indeed, did the first Christians hold the notion that the church is the Kingdom, that they refused even to allow the saints after death to have ascended into the third heaven (see Brooks’ *El. Proph. Inter*., Bickersteth’s *Guide*, etc.), and be in the enjoyment of it, placing them in an intermediate state, awaiting in Hades the coming of the Kingdom (so, e.g., Justin Martyr explicitly declares).

### "Thy Kingdom come"
>Let the reader *refer* e.g. to Prop. 93, Obs. 10, and observe how Tertullian explains the Lord's Prayer.  "Thy Kingdom come" cannot be prayed for by those who already possess it.
