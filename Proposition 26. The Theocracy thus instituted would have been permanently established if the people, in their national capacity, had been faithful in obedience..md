>By this is meant, not that the typical and provisionary adjuncts would have remained unchanged, but that the direct, personal rulership of God (i.e., the distinctive features which constituted it a theocracy) would never have been, for a time, set aside, and that the blessings promised under a Theocratic rule would have been amply realized. No humble believer of the Word, reading the covenant made at Horeb and pondering the blessings and curses announced by Moses, can doubt this supposition. It is true God foreknew the nationâ€™s defection, which is already freely predicted by Moses in his last addresses, but this does not prevent him from offering this Kingdom for their continued acceptance and retention in accordance with moral freedom.

> What God would have done, in case the nation had ever proven faithful, in providing for the Salvation of man (i.e. by way of atonement), we are not concerned, for, while feeling that His wisdom would have been equal to the development of a plan to correspond with such faithfulness, we do know (and this confirms our faith) that this Theocracy itself is formed in an initiatory manner in view of the *foreknown* apostasy, and that out of it, in the royal line, might come the Saviour -- thus vindicating the knowledge of God.  We also are assured, that this same Theocracy -- rejected by some -- contains a divine plan for the accomplishment of great ends, reaching from and through the Jewish nation over the earth; and that the unfaithfulness of man, however it may delay the final result, cannot alter or reverse it. Objections based upon what might have been, or how, in certain contingencies, God would have ordered things, are always unsafe; seeing that we must take affairs as they have transpired and trace God's overruling Providence in them. Taking this scriptural view, it is impossible to break the force, e.g. of Isa. ch. 58 or of Jer. 17:25, which sustain our Proposition.  The expressive language e.g. of Ps. 81:13-16 is sufficient: "O that my people had hearkened unto Me, and Israel had walked in My ways! I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned My hand against their adversaries. The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto Him ; but their time should have endured forever.  He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat; and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee."
