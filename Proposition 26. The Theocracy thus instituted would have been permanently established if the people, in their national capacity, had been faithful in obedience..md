>By this is meant, not that the typical and provisionary adjuncts would have remained unchanged, but that the direct, personal rulership of God (i.e., the distinctive features which constituted it a theocracy) would never have been, for a time, set aside, and that the blessings promised under a Theocratic rule would have been amply realized. No humble believer of the Word, reading the covenant made at Horeb and pondering the blessings and curses announced by Moses, can doubt this supposition. It is true God foreknew the nationâ€™s defection, which is already freely predicted by Moses in his last addresses, but this does not prevent him from offering this Kingdom for their continued acceptance and retention in accordance with moral freedom.

> What God would have done, in case the nation had ever proven faithful, in providing for the Salvation of man (i.e. by way of atonement), we are not concerned, for, while feeling that His wisdom would have been equal to the development of a plan to correspond with such faithfulness, we do know (and this confirms our faith) that this Theocracy itself is formed in an initiatory manner in view of the *foreknown* apostasy, and that out of it, in the royal line, might come the Saviour -- thus vindicating the knowledge of God.  We also are assured, that this same Theocracy -- rejected by some -- contains a divine plan for the accomplishment of great ends, reaching from and through the Jewish nation over the earth; and that the unfaithfulness of man, however it may delay the final result, cannot alter or reverse it. Objections based upon what might have been, or how, in certain contingencies, God would have ordered things, are always unsafe; seeing that we must take affairs as they have transpired and trace God's overruling Providence in them. Taking this scriptural view, it is impossible to break the force, e.g. of Isa. ch. 58 or of Jer. 17:25, which sustain our Proposition.  The expressive language e.g. of Ps. 81:13-16 is sufficient: "O that my people had hearkened unto Me, and Israel had walked in My ways! I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned My hand against their adversaries. The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto Him ; but their time should have endured forever.  He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat; and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee."

> The Theocracy was not simply preparatory but initial, in the sense of its being *a real* Kingdom of God, which was established in order to show forth to the nations of the earth the distinguished blessings flowing from it.  Had the Jewish nation been faithful to its engagements to the Supreme King, had the subordinate rulers obeyed the Supreme Will, *then* the nation would -- as promised -- have multiplied its blessings, enlarged its advantages and power, secured a supremacy over all other people, and become the benefactors of the race in disseminating the knowledge and truth of God.  The place of its manifestation geographically considered (centrally located), the form of government, the special promises given to it, the King at its head, etc., evidence this, but, alas ! depraved human nature forbade its realization.

>it (Theocracy) was *initiatory*, by which we mean that in some of its laws and provisions it was susceptible of changes (but not in its fundamentals).

> The reader will *carefully* observe (as use will be made of it hereafter) that this Theocracy is very different from God's universal, general sovereignty exercised by virtue of His being the Creator.

> The Jews themselves, in e.g. "The Liturgy of the Jews" (Art. on, *Littell's Liv. Age*, Oct. 7th, 1876), acknowledge their sinfulness : "We acknowledge that we have sinned; that we have acted wickedly. O Lord, according to all Thy righteousness, we beseech Thee, let Thy anger and Thy wrath be turned away from Jerusalem, Thy City and Thy Holy Mountain ; for it is on account of our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors that Jerusalem and Thy people are become objects of reproach to all around us," etc.
