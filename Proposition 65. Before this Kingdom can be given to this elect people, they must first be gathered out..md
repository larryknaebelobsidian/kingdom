# Proposition 65. Before this Kingdom can be given to this elect people, they must first be gathered out.

>The nature of the Kingdom as covenanted, and the rejection of the Kingdom by the chosen nation (making such a gathering requisite), requires such an arrangement. The introduction of the faith principle, by which Abraham was justified before circumcision took place, to raise up children to Abraham, merely produces “*the heirs*,” who inherit the Kingdom. The elect are “the guests,” who are first all invited and furnished *before* the marriage feast takes place. The Kingdom is not given—in the sense of being actually realized—to them one by one as gathered, but when all are gathered.
>p. 412 Vol. 1 Prop 65
### Final gathering of all elect
>Obs. 1. This final gathering of all the elect “from one end of heaven to the other,” at the period of inheriting the Kingdom, is mentioned, e.g. Matt. 24:31; Mark 13:27; 2 Thess. 2:1, etc.
>p. 412 Vol. 1 Prop 65 Obs. 1
### Requires open manifestation of the engrafted seed
>Obs. 2. This Kingdom is promised to the direct faithful seed of Abraham, and it is incorporated with the Jewish nation through the adopted and amalgamated Theocratic-Davidic throne and Kingdom. It is likewise promised to the engrafted seed, but necessarily subject to the same incorporation. Hence, until this seed is openly manifested in its nationally engrafted character with the Jewish elect nation (a restoration of the nation being imperative to fulfil covenants), the Kingdom as promised and predicted cannot be established.
### Election connection
>Obs. 3. In view of the Kingdom being thus future, it is reasonable to expect such futurity to be specified in connection with the election.
>. . .
>The Word does not contradict itself Therefore this futurity of the Kingdom is the basis of the numerous exhortations to obtain it, to walk worthily of it, to look, seek, and pray for it.
### God's invitation
>Obs. 4. God for a time leaving the nation first bidden, and treating the Jews as individuals (i.e. not in their national relationship), now invites both Jews and Gentiles to become this people of faith,
>. . .
>In no place is it asserted, that the promised covenanted Kingdom was already in possession of the elect, for such a statement would be palpably contradictory to the most sacred portions of Holy Writ, viz.: to the covenants.
### To all the elected nation
>Obs. 5. This Kingdom is to be given to all of the elected nation, both believing Jews of natural descent and engrafted Gentiles, to all believers, therefore, that have ever lived; and it will be bestowed upon both at the same time, including the Patriarchs, ancient worthies, faithful Jews, and believing adopted Gentiles.

>None of the present saints, (viz.: of this dispensation,) have inherited the Kingdom, for the inheriting is placed in the future, as e.g. Matt. 25:34.
>Obs. 5

>The saints, the elect of this and previous dispensations, are represented as waiting for the Kingdom (comp. Rev. 6:9-11; Luke 18:7, 8; 2 Thess. 1:5-10; Rom. 8:23, etc.).
>Obs. 5
### To be given at a particular time
>Obs. 6. This Kingdom is to be given at a specified appointed time known to God. Without now discussing the predictions, we only refer to the fact that before “the Kingdom, and dominion, and the greatness of the Kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Mod High”( Dan. 7), a certain period of time must first elapse, certain events must first transpire, and then the Kingdom is bestowed. It is given to this people at a particular time or era. The parable of the talents (“after a Iona time” etc.), and of the tares and wheat, the delineation of 2 Thess. 2, and of other passages, illustrate this same truth.
### Called to patiently wait for Christ
>Obs. 7. In comparing Scripture, it will be found that this period of time is stated to be at the era of the Sec. Advent, when this Kingdom will be bestowed upon the elect, Matt. 25:34; Luke 12:32; 2 Thess. 1:5-10, etc. Hence the elect are represented as “called” (1 Thess. 2:12) to this Kingdom, to “a patient waiting for Christ” (2 Thess. 3:5), and “His appearing and Kingdom” (2 Tim. 4:1) are united;—they are exhorted to endure trials that (2 Thess. 1:5) “ye may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God.”
### Christ's Kingdom
>Obs. 8. It may be added, that this future Kingdom covenanted to the elect nation, and which the elect, including the promised Seed, are to inherit, is explicitly called Christ’s Kingdom.

>We are gravely told (comp. Prop. 159) by a multitude that Christ at the end of this dispensation at His Sec. Advent, will deliver up “His Kingdom,” so that, if we are to receive their theory, no such distinctive Kingdom is to exist after the Advent for the elect to inherit. But this notion is to be rejected as utterly untenable and contradictory to the entire tenor of the Word, which locates the Messianic Kingdom at the Sec. Advent (comp. Prop. 159).
### Future things spoken of as present
>Obs. 9. In studying the subject of the Kingdom, we must not be misled by a striking peculiarity of Scripture, viz.: that things still future, owing to their certainty, are spoken of as present.
### Prerequisite moral qualifications including faith and obedience
>Obs. 10. The reader need scarcely be reminded, that in all the elect ones, both ancient and modern, who are to enjoy the Kingdom of God, certain moral qualifications are necessary as a prerequisite. The natural and engrafted seed of Abraham must ail be of faith and obedience. The decisive argument in Romans and Hebrews evinces, this; for while the seed of Abraham is chosen, not every individual is thus favored; while the nation is elected to a Theocratic position, not every member of it will be saved; it is only the faithful portion of Abraham’s seed that is commended and that will be exalted. This has been so ably represented by various writers (as Noel, McNeill, Bickersteth, Bonar, etc.), that it only requires brief mention.
### Gentile inclusion does not remove the election of the Jewish nation
>The Kingdom thus given to these elect ones does *not remove the election* of the Jewish nation as a nation. This, aside from the covenants and the Theocratic ordering allied with the nation, is seen from the fact, that this seed gathered out is virtually regarded as part and parcel of the nation (is a continuation of the election, Prop. 63), and when the nation is nationally restored will be so recognized *in the inheriting with* Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Again, let any one compare Deut. ch. 32, Rom. ch. 11, together with various predictions relating to this elect Jewish nation, and he will find the following succinctly stated: 
>(1) The *Jews* an elect nation (Prop. 24); 
>(2) this nation can render itself unworthy of the Kingdom by disobedience; 
>(3) by its own conduct it will bring upon itself terrible evils and a *temporary* rejection as a nation; 
>(4) the Theocratic rulership will be, for a time, withdrawn; 
>(5) during such a period of rejection, God still continues His work of gathering out of it, and out of the Gentiles, the elect; 
>(6) but the nation itself, for a time under the most severe tribulations, will, owing to this very election (being “*beloved for the Father’s sakes*”), again—as the covenant to be fulfilled demands—*be restored* to the favor of God. 
>This nation, therefore, now under trial, is still *the chosen nation, and this will be manifested in due time* (see Props. Ill to 114). Hence the preference (Luke 24:47; Rom. 1:16; Acts 3:25, 26; Rom. 2:10; Acts 13:46, and 19:21), showed to this nation even after the day of Pentecost in preaching the Gospel—a preference based only upon this election, the Jews being, by virtue of their relationship to Abraham, “*the children of the Kingdom*", and the descendants of those who once enjoyed this Kingdom in its initiatory, incipient form. The natural seed must not, therefore, be ignored; and only upon their refusal to accept of the proffered gospel of the Kingdom were the apostles, and even Paul, authorized to seek after the engrafted ones. One of *the darkest pages* in the history of Christianity is that which records the tendering of insult, wrong, and death instead of the precious message of hope and peace to this covenant favored people.
>p. 416 Vol. 1 Prop 65 Obs 11 (slightly reformatted)
### Great diversity in the elect
>These elect, now gathered out, are in the various denominations of Christians. The diversity, even of doctrine and practice, does not interfere with the possession of *the living engrafting principle* of faith. The former arises incidentally from the liberty allowed to humanity, which, through infirmity, results in doubt and even error being, more or less, mixed with apprehensions of the truth; the latter, however, in the eyes of a just and merciful God, compensates, if followed *by corresponding fruit* in evidence of its sincerity, for the weakness exhibited in the former. The one could not have been obviated without largely infringing man’s moral agency; the other cannot be negatived without interfering with the Divine Will itself.
>p. 417 Vol. 1 Prop 65 Obs 12 
### Some barely saved
>The reader is reminded that while *many* professors are rejected and *few* are chosen, it is also true that out of those saved  some are but barely saved, as by fire, and cannot expect to enjoy that honor of position that others realize in the coming kingdom (comp. Prop. 135).
>. . .
>Enduring temptation and trial is indicative of a proper apprehension of Christ, of the Spirit and truth abiding with us, of our being truly the children of God, of our being the elect. But while enduring under trial, fighting the good fight of faith, it is not for us to sit in judgement over others who may be struggling and tried as we are; it is sufficient to realize in our own experience God's leadings and to enjoy the sweet consciousness of His favor in the fulfillment of promises pertaining to the present life.
>p. 417 Vol. 1 Prop 65 Obs 12 note
### Charged with folly
>Obs. 13. This elect people are charged with folly by others, because they trust in covenanted promises, and in the Seed by whom they shall be fulfilled. This was predicted many centuries ago, Deut. 32:21, and is pointedly referred to in 1 Cor. 1:26-28.
### Arrogance
>Obs. 14. Many claim, some arrogantly, that they alone are these elected ones and all others, outside of their organization or doctrinal position, are excluded.
### Fundamental union shown 
>Our line of argument clearly shows a fundamental union and vital connection between the two: it also proves the perpetual election of a seed and the ultimate fulfilment in that Abrahamic seed of all that has been covenanted, promised, and predicted in the Old and New Tests.
>Obs. 15
