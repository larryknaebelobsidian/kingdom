>The Kingdom thus given to these elect ones does *not remove the election* of the Jewish nation as a nation. This, aside from the covenants and the Theocratic ordering allied with the nation, is seen from the fact, that this seed gathered out is virtually regarded as part and parcel of the nation (is a continuation of the election, Prop. 63), and when the nation is nationally restored will be so recognized *in the inheriting with* Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Again, let any one compare Deut. ch. 32, Rom. ch. 11, together with various predictions relating to this elect Jewish nation, and he will find the following succinctly stated: 
>(1) The *Jews* an elect nation (Prop. 24); 
>(2) this nation can render itself unworthy of the Kingdom by disobedience; 
>(3) by its own conduct it will bring upon itself terrible evils and a *temporary* rejection as a nation; 
>(4) the Theocratic rulership will be, for a time, withdrawn; 
>(5) during such a period of rejection, God still continues His work of gathering out of it, and out of the Gentiles, the elect; 
>(6) but the nation itself, for a time under the most severe tribulations, will, owing to this very election (being “*beloved for the Father’s sakes*”), again—as the covenant to be fulfilled demands—*be restored* to the favor of God. 
>This nation, therefore, now under trial, is still *the chosen nation, and this will be manifested in due time* (see Props. Ill to 114). Hence the preference (Luke 24:47; Rom. 1:16; Acts 3:25, 26; Rom. 2:10; Acts 13:46, and 19:21), showed to this nation even after the day of Pentecost in preaching the Gospel—a preference based only upon this election, the Jews being, by virtue of their relationship to Abraham, “*the children of the Kingdom*", and the descendants of those who once enjoyed this Kingdom in its initiatory, incipient form. The natural seed must not, therefore, be ignored; and only upon their refusal to accept of the proffered gospel of the Kingdom were the apostles, and even Paul, authorized to seek after the engrafted ones. One of *the darkest pages* in the history of Christianity is that which records the tendering of insult, wrong, and death instead of the precious message of hope and peace to this covenant favored people.

>These elect, now gathered out, are in the various denominations of Christians. The diversity, even of doctrine and practice, does not interfere with the possession of *the living engrafting principle* of faith. The former arises incidentally from the liberty allowed to humanity, which, through infirmity, results in doubt and even error being, more or less, mixed with apprehensions of the truth; the latter, however, in the eyes of a just and merciful God, compensates, if followed *by corresponding fruit* in evidence of its sincerity, for the weakness exhibited in the former. The one could not have been obviated without largely infringing man’s moral agency; the other cannot be negatived without interfering with the Divine Will itself.

>The reader is reminded that while *many* professors are rejected and *few* are chosen, it is also true that out of those saved  some are but barely saved, as by fire, and cannot expect to enjoy that honor of position that others realize in the coming kingdom (comp. Prop. 135).

>Enduring temptation and trial is indicative of a proper apprehension of Christ, of the Spirit and truth abiding with us, of our being truly the children of God, of our being the elect. But while enduring under trial, fighting the good fight of faith, it is not for us to sit in judgement over others who may be struggling and tried as we are; it is sufficient to realize in our own experience God's leadings and to enjoy the sweet consciousness of His favor in the fulfillment of promises pertaining to the present life.
