>The Kingdom thus given to these elect ones does *not remove the election* of the Jewish nation as a nation. This, aside from the covenants and the Theocratic ordering allied with the nation, is seen from the fact, that this seed gathered out is virtually regarded as part and parcel of the nation (is a continuation of the election, Prop. 63), and when the nation is nationally restored will be so recognized *in the inheriting with* Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Again, let any one compare Deut. ch. 32, Rom. ch. 11, together with various predictions relating to this elect Jewish nation, and he will find the following succinctly stated: 
>(1) The *Jews* an elect nation (Prop. 24); 
>(2) this nation can render itself unworthy of the Kingdom by disobedience; 
>(3) by its own conduct it will bring upon itself terrible evils and a *temporary* rejection as a nation; 
>(4) the Theocratic rulership will be, for a time, withdrawn; 
>(5) during such a period of rejection, God still continues His work of gathering out of it, and out of the Gentiles, the elect; 
>(6) but the nation itself, for a time under the most severe tribulations, will, owing to this very election (being “*beloved for the Father’s sakes*”), again—as the covenant to be fulfilled demands—*be restored* to the favor of God. 
>This nation, therefore, now under trial, is still *the chosen nation, and this will be manifested in due time* (see Props. Ill to 114). Hence the preference (Luke 24:47; Rom. 1:16; Acts 3:25, 26; Rom. 2:10; Acts 13:46, and 19:21), showed to this nation even after the day of Pentecost in preaching the Gospel—a preference based only upon this election, the Jews being, by virtue of their relationship to Abraham, “*the children of the Kingdom*", and the descendants of those who once enjoyed this Kingdom in its initiatory, incipient form. The natural seed must not, therefore, be ignored; and only upon their refusal to accept of the proffered gospel of the Kingdom were the apostles, and even Paul, authorized to seek after the engrafted ones. One of *the darkest pages* in the history of Christianity is that which records the tendering of insult, wrong, and death instead of the precious message of hope and peace to this covenant favored people.
