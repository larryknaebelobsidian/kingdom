# Proposition 166. The rudimentary reorganization of this Kingdom will be made at Mt. Sinai.
### Props Mentioned
[[Proposition 121. This Kingdom, of necessity, requires a Pre-Millennial Personal Advent of Jesus Christ.|121]] [[Proposition 130. The Kingdom is preceded by a translation of the living saints.|130]] 

>The organization of the Theocracy was affected before the Jewish nation entered Palestine. The appointment of officials, the giving of laws, the commandments to destroy the enemies of God, etc., were issued at Mt. Sinai. It is eminently suitable that the reorganization of the same should be effected in the same place.
>p. 17 Vol. 3 Prop 166

>Obs. 1. Taking it for granted that the Theocracy will be again reorganized in its Theocratic-Davidic form, so that God in the person of David’s descendant (inseparably connected) again condescends to dwell with the Jewish nation, and act in the capacity of an earthly ruler, we may suggest, that if such is the divine order, no place on earth could be selected more suitable or letter adapted for such an arrangement than Mt. Sinai, and its adjoining territory.

>Obs. 2. In considering this subject, some preliminary matters must be duly regarded, viz. 
>(1) That   the most prominent students of prophecy are now agreed that the Second Advent, to be appreciated, must be comprehended in its *several phases*, being *at first* secret, hidden to carry out certain purposes, and *finally* open, revealed. The reasons for this belief are given under Prop. 130.
>(2) That the First Advent, embracing within itself about thirty-three years, teaches us not *to limit* the acts of Jesus at the Second within a brief period of time; and that His preparatory private life of about thirty years before His open manifestation to the nation, should lead us not to circumscribe His Second Advent to an immediate open Revelation, unless a comparison of Scripture makes it absolutely necessary. 
>(3) That if it be admitted that the establishment of the Theocracy at .Mt. Sinai was a pattern of something that should follow in the future (which nearly all writers confess however much they may differ in the ultimate fulfilment), *then* an open door is at once presented for the introduction of our Proposition. 
>(4) That the passages bearing on this subject are to be considered in their *general scope*, in their *connection* with context and analogy, and shall involve *no contradiction* of Scripture.

>Obs. 3. The Bible seems to declare that Jesus, the Messiah, at His Second Advent, will especially exhibit *two* acts or phases in this Coming, and *between* these two, He and His saints will pass *the intervening period at Mt. Sinai*. That he comes “as a thief” *for* the removal of the saints is clearly taught, and that He also openly comes *with* these saints on the Mt. of Olives (Zech. 14:4) is unmistakably announced. But He and His saints are also represented as being at Mt. Sinai. A comparison of Scripture shows, that when the saints are removed by the power of resurrection and translation, they *do not remain in “the air,”* but are conveyed *to Mt. Sinai*, where, as at the establishment of the Theocracy, *positions* are assigned, *the kingship and priesthood* inaugurated, the *instructions* given preparatory to the ushering in of “the dispensation of the fulness of times.” After all the preparations are completed, and the time has come for “*the manifestation of the sons of God*,” the deliverance of the Jewish nation, the destruction of Antichrist, *this associated body of Rulers with the King of kings at their head* (Rev. 19) present themselves to the confusion of ail enemies, and to the joy of the ancient elect nation.

>Obs. 4. If this deduction were founded simply on one passage it might suggest doubt, but we find it sustained in other places.

#### Deut. 33:1-2
Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death. 2 And he said, “Yahweh came from Sinai, And He dawned on them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran,
And He came from the midst of ten thousand holy ones; At His right hand there was flashing lightning for them.

#### Hab. 3:3
God comes from Teman, And the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. 
His splendor covers the heavens,
And the earth is full of His praise.

Judges 5:4, 5,
O Yahweh, when You went out from Seir,
When You marched from the field of Edom,
The earth quaked, the heavens also dripped,
Even the clouds dripped water.
5 The mountains flowed at the presence of Yahweh,
This Sinai, at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
 

>Isa. 63:1-6 cannot possibly, without the grossest inconsistency, be applied to the First Advent of Jesus. For, aside from other reasons, it is not true that He then came in anger, fury and vengeance, and shed the blood of His enemies, until His own garments were stained, seeing that His mission was one of love, mercy and submission to death. But at His Second Advent numerous passages *expressly mention* wrath, vengeance on enemies, and a fearful slaughter and supper. It is therefore a description *only applicable* to the Second Advent, as the early Church taught (see Prop. 121). But the prophet in vision sees Him Coming from the direction of Mt. Sinai, asking: “*Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah*? Indeed, when we come to compare Scripture with Scripture, we have *the route* taken by the mighty King *from Mt. Sinai until He arrives at Jerusalem* clearly pointed out. Prophecy distinctly mentions Mt. Sinai, Paran, the Wilderness, Mt. Seir, Edom, Teman or the South, Bozrah, giving us *a direct route* from Sinai *northward* to Palestine. This does not occur *by chance, but is descriptive of what shall truly take place*. Having the Mighty One with His Saints manifested at Sinai, and also by way of the wilderness of Paran on through Idumea, it seems to us faithless not to accept of these things.
>p. 22 Vol. 3 Prop 166 Obs. 5

Isaiah 63:1-6 (LSB)
Who is this who comes from Edom,
With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah,
This One who is majestic in His clothing,
Marching in the greatness of His power?
“It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.”
2 Why is Your clothing red,
And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press?
3 “I have trodden the wine trough alone,
And from the peoples there was no man with Me.
I also trod them in My anger
And trampled them in My wrath;
And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments,
And I stained all My clothes.
4 For the day of vengeance was in My heart,
And My year of redemption has come.
5 I looked, and there was no one to help,
And I was astonished, and there was no one to uphold;
So My own arm brought salvation to Me,
And My wrath upheld Me.
6 I trod down the peoples in My anger
And made them drunk in My wrath,
And I brought down their lifeblood to the earth.”

>Obs. 8. This removal to Mt. Sinai, and the union there consummated of Theocratic relationship (likened owing to its intimate, enduring, and permanent character, to a marriage), satisfactorily explains some allusions to the future marriage, which many writers ignore or fail to conciliate.
