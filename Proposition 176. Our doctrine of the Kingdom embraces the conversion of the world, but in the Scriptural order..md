# Proposition 176. Our doctrine of the Kingdom embraces the conversion of the world, but in the Scriptural order.

>While rejecting the Whitbyan theory of a future conversion of the world *previous* to the Second Advent of Jesus as unscriptural and misleading, we at the same time firmly hold to a future blessed and glorious conversion of the Jews and Gentiles *after* the Sec. Advent, as plainly taught in the Word.
>p. 210 Vol. 3 Prop. 176 

>He is now doing His work in the process of gathering a people for God, and this, we contend, is only *the earnest* of a greater still to come. (*Comp. Prop.* 171.)
>p. 213 Vol. 3 Prop. 176 Obs. 5

>In view of our doctrines respecting the conversion of the world, the Kingdom of Christ, etc., we are unjustly accused as "traitors to the Church," or, at least, of taking "little interest in her welfare."
>p. 214 Vol. 3 Prop. 176 Obs. 5 note

>When the Theocratic ordering is in full sway, then this will be forcibly realized. To this period belong such passages as the following: Ps. 22:27,28, "*All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord; and all the Kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. For the Kingdom is the Lord's; and He is the Governor among the nations.*" Ps. 9:1-8; Ps. 21:7-13, etc.
>p. 215 Vol. 3 Prop. 176 Obs. 6 note
### Psalm 9:1-8
I will give thanks to Yahweh with all my heart;
I will recount all Your wondrous deeds.
א ALEPH
2 I will be glad and exult in You;
I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.
ב BETH
3 When my enemies turn back,
They stumble and perish before You.
4 For You have maintained my justice and my cause;
You have sat on the throne judging righteously.
ג GIMEL
5 You have rebuked the nations, You have made the wicked perish;
You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
ה HE
6 The enemy has come to an end in perpetual ruins,
And You have uprooted the cities;
The very memory of them has perished.
ו VAV
7 But Yahweh abides forever;
He has established His throne for judgment,
ו VAV
8 And He will judge the world in righteousness;
He will render justice for the peoples with equity.

### Psalm 21:7-13
For the king trusts in Yahweh,
And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he will not be shaken.
8 Your hand will find out all your enemies;
Your right hand will find out those who hate you.
9 You will make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger;
Yahweh will swallow them up in His wrath,
And fire will devour them.
10 Their offspring You will destroy from the earth,
And their seed from among the sons of men.
11 Though they intended evil against You
_And_ devised a scheme,
They will not succeed.
12 For You will make them turn their back;
You will aim with Your bowstrings at their faces.
13 Be exalted, O Yahweh, in Your strength;
We will sing and praise Your might.

>Our doctrine makes the saints, counted worthy to inherit the Kingdom with David’s Son, *happy participants* in this process of converting the nations of the earth. This opens before us a bright and beautiful aspect of *saintly agency* in the future, when “the elect” are manifested as the revealed kings and priests of the earth.
>p. 215 Vol. 3 Prop. 176 Obs. 7

>The reader will find this feature extended in detail, with Scripture proof, under Props. 154 and 156.  It is delightful to contemplate, that we who are the redeemed "first-fruits," shall be able practically to manifest our supreme love to God by bringing others to experience its blessings in acknowledgment of the supremacy and majesty of the King.
>p. 215 Vol. 3 Prop. 176 Obs. 7 note

>One of the indirect, but most powerful, evidences of the divine inspiration of the Scripture is found in the fact that nowhere do we find those eulogistic descriptions of "the triumph of the Gospel in subduing the world" which now so largely adorn the eloquence of Whitbyan missionary discourses.  Nothing of the kind is exhibited even when reference is made to the rapid extension of the preached Word over the then known world, for the Spirit evidently foresaw, what history testifies to, the ultimate overthrow and fallen condition of the churches, then so widely extended. If the hopes and efforts of believers are to be quickened by such appeals -- as men now say -- *why were they not given* at a time when Christians endured the severest trials from a persecuting Roman Empire?
>p. 215 Vol. 3 Prop. 176 Obs. 8 note

>This doctrine of ours prominently holds forth, as a cardinal point, the design of the present dispensation, and insists upon it that wherever the design is specifically mentioned, it is “to gather out a people for His name,” “to save them that believe,” or to bring appropriated salvation to “the few” in contrast to “the many” who reject it—a process which has been going on uninterruptedly for eighteen centuries.
>p. 216 Vol. 3 Prop. 176 Obs. 9 

>In direct contrast with this biblical teaching, eminent and eloquent men teach that its design is the reverse, viz., to gather all people, to save the many, to convert all nations.
>p. 216 Vol. 3 Prop. 176 Obs. 9 note
