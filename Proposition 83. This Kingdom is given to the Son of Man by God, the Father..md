# Proposition 83. This Kingdom is given to the Son of Man by God, the Father.

>This bestowal of the Kingdom to the Son of Man by the Father, is clearly and explicitly taught in the covenant. Hence in agreement with it, we have the language of Dan. 7:13, 14, Isa. 49; Luke, 22:29 and 1:32, etc. The Divine Sovereignty insures it unto Him.
>p. 572 Vol. 1 Prop. 83
### Kingdom different than Divine sovereignty
>Obs. 1. This giving of the Kingdom by the Father to the Son of Man, shows, what has already been observed, that this Kingdom is something very different from the general Divine Sovereignty exercised by God.
### At the second advent
>Obs. 2. This Kingdom is given to the Son of Man at a particular, definite time.
>...
>the peculiar phraseology, corroborated by the prophets and applied by Jesus, unmistakably refers it to the Sec. Advent, which we have already seen (e.g. Props. 56-68), is the designated time for taking the Kingdom.
### Helps detect error
>Obs. 3. By simply keeping in the line of the covenanted Kingdom which the Father in the appointed time, still future, will bestow upon the Son of David, we know how to estimate that vast mass of mystical conceptions and spiritualistic descriptions given by Origen, Swedenborg, Randolp, and a host of others, of the predicted Kingdom being now already realized in some form, or to be experienced immediately after death.
### Deferred ultimate exaltation until the second advent
>Obs. 4. Because we are told (Heb. 10:12), that “this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God,” it is inferred that this exaltation of the human nature embraces the predicted rulership of the Son of Man. But in this very connection (next verse), as if to guard us against such an inference, it is added: “From henceforth expecting” (Barnes, etc., “waiting,” ) “till His enemies be made his footstool.” All commentators agree that this overthrow and subjection is still future, and the Scriptures teach in the plainest manner that it is connected with His Sec. Advent.

### Both Father and Son conquer enemies
>Obs. 5. The Sovereignty of the Father is the foundation, the security, that David’s Son shall obtain this Kingdom at the allotted time, and, therefore, this Sovereignty is also represented as giving up into the hands of this Son of Man all his enemies. Hence, in view of the Oneness of the Father and Son, one class of passages intimate that the enemies of Christ are given into His power by the Father, and yet when the work of subduing these enemies is specifically stated and in detail, it is one assigned to the Son (sustained by His relationship to the Father), because the Father commits all judgment and the Judgeship to Christ as the Son of Man, and Jesus, at His revelation, is described as coming in vengeance, etc. Therefore it becomes the student to allow both classes of passages their due position and weight in the order of procedure.
### Subordinate to the Divine will of the Father
>Obs. 6. The Kingdom being given by the Father to the Son of Man, we can, keeping this fact in view, appreciate the fact stated in 1 Cor. 15:27, 28, viz: “But when He saith, All things are put under Him, it is manifested that He is excepted, which did put all things under Him,” etc.
>...
>a Theocracy—in the very nature of the case, as seen in the form of the Kingdom, in its past history as given, and in the manner of its future restoration under David’s Son—must ever retain the position of being subordinate to the Divine Will of the Father.

### Christ's current headship over the church is not his covenanted theocratic rule
Obs. 7

### Exact time of giving the Kingdom to the Son of Man is not revealed
>Obs. 8. The exact time when the Father will give this Kingdom to “the Son of Man” is not revealed.>

### "the man"
>Obs. 9. When this Kingdom is given by the Father then will be perfected the covenanted arrangement concerning “the Man” as indicated in 2 Sam. 7:19 and 1 Chron. 17:17 (comp, the Davidic covenant under Prop. 49).

>Therefore it follows, taking covenant promises for our guide, that this Plan respecting the Kingdom is made in virtue of the humanity of Christ, His relationship to Man in the Davidic line; and God the Father will not allow this Plan to fail, but will in due time exhibit His Theocratic rule in and through the Man ordained.
