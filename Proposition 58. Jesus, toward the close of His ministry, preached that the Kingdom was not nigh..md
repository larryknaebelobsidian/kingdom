>If indeed, the covenanted Davidic Kingdom is offered, and that tender is rejected through unwillingness to repent, *then it follows*, from the foreknowledge lodged in Jesus, that it is reasonable to expect some such procedure. The statement in the Proposition is abundantly confirmed. Just *so soon* as the representatives of the nation met in council and conspired to put Jesus to death, *then*, released from the first part of His mission, *His style of preaching also changed*. Instead of proclaiming that the Kingdom was nigh to the nation, He now directly intimates and declares that *it was not nigh*. Matt. 21:43, “*The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof*” is already conclusive (as will be shown hereafter), confirmed as it is by other passages.
>p. 379 Vol. 1 Prop 58

All Observations in this Proposition are worthy of detailed study.
