>If indeed, the covenanted Davidic Kingdom is offered, and that tender is rejected through unwillingness to repent, *then it follows*, from the foreknowledge lodged in Jesus, that it is reasonable to expect some such procedure. The statement in the Proposition is abundantly confirmed. Just *so soon* as the representatives of the nation met in council and conspired to put Jesus to death, *then*, released from the first part of His mission, *His style of preaching also changed*. Instead of proclaiming that the Kingdom was nigh to the nation, He now directly intimates and declares that *it was not nigh*. Matt. 21:43, “*The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof*” is already conclusive (as will be shown hereafter), confirmed as it is by other passages.
>p. 379 Vol. 1 Prop 58

All Observations in this Proposition are worthy of detailed study.

### Marriage of the King's son, Matt. 22:1-14
>take the parable of the marriage of the King’s son, Matt. 22:1-14, given just after (Matt. 21:43), He declared that the Kingdom should be taken from them, and we have: 
>1. (1) The Jewish nation bidden but refusing the invitation (showing the sincerity of the offer, etc.); 
>2. (2) if the invitation had been accepted, the marriage would have taken place, but the invited guests refusing, it was postponed until other guests were furnished; 
>3. (3) the marriage (i.e. the enthronement to the Kingdom, comp. Prop. 169), the wedding (i.e. the inauguration blessings and privileges, the Kingdom being likened to a feast, Prop. 169), were no longer nigh to these invited ones; 
>4. (4) the marriage, the time when the guests are scrutinized, is (as commentators inform us correctly) at the Sec. Advent of this King, hence postponed until that period.
> Obs. 1

### The Great Supper, Luke 14:15-24
>Again: the parable of the Great Supper, Luke 14:15-24, has also reference to this fact. It was suggested by the saying, “Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God,” i.e. in this Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom, for such was the meaning attached to the phrase. Jesus, in reply, expressively shows how this Kingdom was received. The persons (Jews) specially invited to this “great supper” (i.e. to the blessings of this Kingdom) rejected the invitation, for “they all with one consent began to make excuse,” and other guests are to be invited, urged to come and enjoy it, whilst “none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper,” i.e. it was no longer nigh to those invited. The calling of other guests now (still going on) takes the place of the first invitation—a new exigency and preparation being evolved—and the supper, until these guests are obtained (Prop. 65) is postponed to the Sec. Advent (Prop. 169).
