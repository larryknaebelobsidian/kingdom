# Proposition 58. Jesus, toward the close of His ministry, preached that the Kingdom was not nigh.

### Matthew 21:43
>If indeed, the covenanted Davidic Kingdom is offered, and that tender is rejected through unwillingness to repent, *then it follows*, from the foreknowledge lodged in Jesus, that it is reasonable to expect some such procedure. The statement in the Proposition is abundantly confirmed. Just *so soon* as the representatives of the nation met in council and conspired to put Jesus to death, *then*, released from the first part of His mission, *His style of preaching also changed*. Instead of proclaiming that the Kingdom was nigh to the nation, He now directly intimates and declares that *it was not nigh*. Matt. 21:43, “*The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof*” is already conclusive (as will be shown hereafter), confirmed as it is by other passages.

***All Observations in this Proposition are worthy of detailed study.***

### Marriage of the King's son, Matt. 22:1-14
>take the parable of the marriage of the King’s son, Matt. 22:1-14, given just *after* (Matt. 21:43), He declared that the Kingdom should be taken from them, and we have: 
>1. (1) *The Jewish nation* bidden but refusing the invitation (showing the sincerity of the offer, etc.); 
>2. (2) if the invitation had been accepted, *the marriage would have taken place*, but the invited guests refusing, it *was postponed* until other guests were furnished; 
>3. (3) the marriage (i.e. the enthronement to the Kingdom, comp. Prop. 169), the wedding (i.e. the inauguration blessings and privileges, the Kingdom being likened to a feast, Prop. 169), were *no longer nigh* to these invited ones; 
>4. (4) the marriage, the time when the guests are scrutinized, is (as commentators inform us correctly) at the Sec. Advent of this King, *hence postponed until that period*.
> p. 379 Vol. 1 Prop 58 Obs. 1

### The Great Supper, Luke 14:15-24
>Again: the parable of the Great Supper, Luke 14:15-24, has also reference to this fact. It was suggested by the saying, “*Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God*,” i.e. in this Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom, for such was the meaning attached to the phrase. Jesus, in reply, expressively shows how this Kingdom was received. The persons (Jews) *specially invited* to this “great supper” (i.e. to the blessings of this Kingdom) *rejected* the invitation, for “they all with one consent began to make excuse,” and other guests are to be invited, urged to come and enjoy it, whilst “none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper,” i.e. *it was no longer nigh* to those invited. The calling of other guests now (still going on) takes the place of the first invitation—a new exigency and preparation being evolved—and the supper, until these guests are obtained (Prop. 65) is *postponed* to the Sec. Advent (Prop. 169).

>For this postponement of the Kingdom, so constantly ignored by Christian Apologists, is *a most powerful factor* in the criticism, both of the Gospel writings and the Gospel History.  It conclusively proves that the great object of the writers, in all of them, was to show -- 
>1. (1) That Jesus was the Messiah; 
>2. (2) why the Messianic Kingdom was delayed; when and through whom it shall be established
>The idea of postponement (even contained in the references to a future coming of Himself in glory, and which caused the question of the disciples in Matt. 24:3 respecting His future coming), must have singularly impressed the disciples, owing to their utter inability to reconcile it with His death. Without comment, they give us a complete history of the facts as they existed, and do not conceal the perplexity in which they were involved, owing to their having allied to the First Advent promises which are only to be realized at the Second.

### Luke 19:41-44
>1. (1) Jesus weeping over the city; 
>2. (2) the things which belonged unto their peace, being rejected, were hid from them; 
>3. (3) the evil results of their unbelief, in being given over to their enemies and continuing under their power; 
>4. (4) this great evil brought upon them because they appreciated not the offer made, because “thou knowest not the time of thy visitation.” *Here, instead of a Kingdom, is presented a direful threatening of fearful incoming evils*.
>p. 380 Vol. 1 Prop 58 Obs. 2 reformatted
### Matt. 23:37, 38
>1. (1) the rejection of His message, evinced by the treatment of those sent; 
>2. (2) Christ’s earnest desire that they might receive it; 
>3. (3) but “they would not,” indicating a voluntary rejection; 
>4. (4) then “*the house left desolate*", no restoration being granted; 
>5. (5) and Christ’s *withdrawal* from them for a time; 
>6. (6) so that, *instead of a Kingdom coming then to them*, dispersion and the destruction of the city is determined, owing to their unrepentant state.

### Change in interval
>At the beginning of His ministry, it was relatively nigh (as we have shown); the offer was simply conditioned by repentance; and being left to their choice, no long interval, as here intimated, must take place before it is nigh to them. Now, however, since His death was actually contemplated by the representatives of the nation, the offer is withdrawn, and the postponement of the Kingdom, its not being nigh to them, *is directly stated by an enumeration of certain events which are previously* to take place before it is nigh again.
>p. 381 Vol. 1  Prop 58 Obs. 3
### Misunderstood immediate appearance
>Obs. 4. Luke 19:11-27 forcibly demonstrates our Proposition.
>p. 382 Vol. 1  Prop 58 Obs. 4

>For there is (as there could not be) no declaration that they were wrong in believing that the Kingdom which they expected, the Messianic, *was still in the future*. They were only mistaken in the opinion, carefully announced, “*that the Kingdom of God should immediately appear*”. Now the parable is given *to correct* this belief in *the immediate setting up* of the Kingdom, to indicate that *it would not soon appear*, but *only after* an undefined period of time had elapsed.
>p. 382 Vol. 1  Prop 58 Obs. 4
### Open predictions of death and resurrection toward close of His ministry
>Obs. 5. It is worthy of notice, that Christ only openly predicted His sufferings and death toward *the close* of His ministry, Matt. 20:17-20, John 12:32-34, etc.
>p. 383 Vol. 1  Prop 58 Obs. 5
### Change of preaching wrongfully interpreted by some
>Obs. 6. This change of preaching in Jesus has been noticed by Renan and others, and they *wrongfully* attribute it to a change of plan respecting the Kingdom, forced upon Him by attending circumstances. That is, seeing that He could not secure the throne and Kingdom over the Jewish nation, He concluded to erect a more spiritual Kingdom.
>...
>Renan and his class *totally ignore* the abundance of Scripture assigning *the reasons for postponement*, just as if they had no existence.
>p. 384 Vol. 1  Prop 58 Obs. 6
### Not merely Jewish temporal blessings and rewards
>Obs. 7. The notion entertained by some, that *only* temporal blessings and rewards were offered to the Jews under the Levitical economy, is also shown (as before noticed), by the tender of this Kingdom and its postponement, to be erroneous.
>p. 384 Vol. 1  Prop 58 Obs. 7
### Change in Christ's public title as "the Christ"
>Obs. 8. In view of this foreknown change in the preaching of Jesus resulting from a postponement of the Kingdom, Christ did not *publicly* assume in His personal ministry the title of “*the Christ*” until *after* His betrayal, Mark 14:62. After the death of John the Baptist, which already foreshadowed His own rejection and the nation’s refusal of the tender, of the Kingdom, He strictly charged His disciples *to tell no man* that He was “*the Christ*.”
>p. 384-385 Vol. 1  Prop 58 Obs. 8

>One of the best writers on this point is Judge Jones, in his *Notes on Scripture* (as e.g. on Matt. 16:20 and 23:8, etc.), and in his *Essays* (Phil-Basilieus) attached to vol. 3 of the *Literalist*. The Judge, with his fine scholarship, theological learning, and eminent legal abilities, was well calculated to see and bring out points unnoticed by the large class of expositors. Among other things he notices the remarkable change in the phraseology as seen in Acts and the Epistles when compared with the Gospels, and justly argues that, as the name of Jesus, the title of Son of man, was designedly given at one period, and the titles of Christ and Messiah were kept in the background, so also *after* the death and ascension of Jesus the title of Christ is purposely more prominently exhibited. The former procedure is based on the fact of the offer and rejection of the Kingdom; the latter is founded on the fact that this same Jesus, dead, buried, and crucified, is nevertheless "the Christ", and that the covenanted promises *will yet* be realized through Him.  The very title implies faith and hope in *the fulfillment* of the covenants.
