## Isaiah 9:6-7
For a [[child]] will be born to us, a [[son]] will be given to us;
And the [[government]] will rest on His shoulders;
And [[His name]] will be called [[Wonderful Counselor]], [[Mighty God]],
[[Eternal Father]], [[Prince of Peace]].

7 There will be [[no end to the increase of _His_ government or of peace]],
On the [[throne of David]] and over [[his kingdom]],
To establish it and to uphold it with [[justice]] and [[righteousness]]
From then on and [[forevermore]].
The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will accomplish this.
The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will accomplish this.

## Isaiah 11
1 Then a shoot will spring from the [[stem of Jesse]],
And a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
2 The [[Spirit of Yahweh]] will rest on Him,
The [[spirit of wisdom and understanding]],
The [[spirit of counsel and might]],
The [[spirit of knowledge]] and the [[fear of Yahweh]].
3 And He will delight in the [[fear of Yahweh]],
And He will not judge by what His eyes see,
Nor render a decision by what His ears hear;
4 But with [[righteousness]] He will judge [[the poor]],
And decide with uprightness for [[the afflicted]] of the earth;
And He will strike the earth with [[the rod of His mouth]],
And with the breath of His lips He will [[put the wicked to death]].
5 Also [[righteousness]] will be the belt about His loins,
And [[faithfulness]] the belt about His waist.


## Micah 5:2-4
2 But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
Too little to be among the clans of Judah,
From you One will go forth for Me to be [[ruler]] in Israel.
His goings forth are from [[everlasting]],
From the [[ancient days]].‚Äù
3 Therefore He will give them up until the time
When she who is in childbirth has borne a child.
Then the remainder of His brothers
Will return to the sons of Israel.
4 And He will stand and [[shepherd His flock]]
In the strength of Yahweh,
In the majesty of the name of Yahweh His God.
And they will remain
Because at that time [[He will be great]]
To the ends of the earth.
