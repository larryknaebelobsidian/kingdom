# Proposition 39. John the Baptist was not ignorant of the Kingdom that he preached.

>The prevailing view, indorsed by a multitude of eminent theologians, is that John was *ignorant of* i.e., did not understand the nature of, the Kingdom he proclaimed.
>p. 256 Vol. 1 Prop. 39
### Any theory denying John's understanding of the kingdom is unworthy
>Obs. 1. Any theory of the Kingdom which makes the first great preacher of the Kingdom—a preacher *specially* prepared, sent, and inspired—ignorant of the leading subject that he was delegated, specifically commissioned to announce, is not only open to the gravest suspicion, but *ought to be rejected* as unworthy of God.
>p. 256 Vol. 1 Prop. 39 Obs. 1
### John's conception of the kingdom
>What was John’s conception of the Messiah’s Kingdom? Let those who consider John to be mistaken inform us, and let the reader judge for himself whether it is not *the very idea* of the Kingdom embraced in *the grammatical sense* of the prophets (Prop. 21), and in a restored Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom. Thus e.g. Neander (Life of Christ, ch. 2, s. 40) truthfully admits that “he expects this Kingdom to be visible,” “existing in communion with the divine life, *with the Messiah as its visible King*; so that, what had not been the case before, *the idea of the Theocracy and its manifestation should precisely correspond to each other,*” and “his expectations of *a visible realization of the Theocracy shows him as yet upon Old Test. ground*.” That is, John expected *the restoration of the Theocracy* in an exalted manner under the Messiah, *just* as the prophets *plainly* predicted.
>p. 256 Vol. 1 Prop. 39 Obs. 2
### If John is deluded, whom can we trust?
>Obs. 3. If John is *specially called* to preach this Kingdom, and yet labors under delusion, gross error respecting its nature, we ask, Whom, then, can we trust?
>p. 257 Vol. 1 Prop. 39 Obs. 3
### Omission of the substance of John's message of the kingdom
>Obs. 5. The reader will find, in looking over authors, interpreters, etc., that many of them, whilst having much to say about John’s preaching repentance, omit, as a tender subject beset with difficulties, *all allusions* to his preaching the Kingdom, although repentance is only described as a means for attaining to the Kingdom.
>p. 258 Vol. 1 Prop. 39 Obs. 5
### Rejecting John's view and accepting others
>Obs. 6. Those, of course, who assume that the weakest believer who now attempts to preach the Kingdom of God is far greater than John (Prop. 38, Obs. 1) have no hesitancy in rejecting John’s views of the Kingdom.
>p. 258 Vol. 1 Prop. 39 Obs. 6
