>What was John’s conception of the Messiah’s Kingdom? Let those who consider John to be mistaken inform us, and let the reader judge for himself whether it is not the very idea of the Kingdom embraced in the grammatical sense of the prophets (Prop. 21), and in a restored Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom. Thus e.g. Neander (Life of Christ, ch. 2, s. 40) truthfully admits that “he expects this Kingdom to be visible,” “existing in communion with the divine life, with the Messiah as its visible King; so that, what had not been the case before, the idea of the Theocracy and its manifestation should precisely correspond to each other,” and “his expectations of a visible realization of the Theocracy shows him as yet upon Old Test. ground.” That is, John expected the restoration of the Theocracy in an exalted manner under the Messiah, just as the prophets plainly predicted.
