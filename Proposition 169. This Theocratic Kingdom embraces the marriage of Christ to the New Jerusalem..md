# Proposition 169. This Theocratic Kingdom embraces the marriage of Christ to the New Jerusalem.

### Props Mentioned
79 84 118 148 149 150 151 168 170 

>Our object under this heading is merely to show *who* the Bride is, and to explain *what* is meant by the marriage relation.
>p. 39 Vol. 3 Prop. 169
### Bride is the New Jerusalem
>Obs. 1. The Bride is the city New Jerusalem, for *a city is* in prophetical language, (as well as in that of other writers), *personified* by a woman or virgin.
>p. 39 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 1

Attempted interpretations of the New Jerusalem
1. figurative or symbolical representation of the Church
2. the risen and glorified saints
3. magnificent emblem of the future state -- including residence -- of the redeemed
4. a figurative representation of the Church
5. restored Eden or Paradise
6. the third heaven or a scene or place in heaven
7. renewed state of the Church
8. the national polity of the Jews during the millennium
9. a literal city

>Indeed the Church is (as we shall show hereafter) married, i.e. brought into *intimate and endearing union* with Christ, even in *a higher and nobler sense* than this city, inasmuch as a glorification after the pattern of Christ, and co-heirship with Him in the rulership, etc., of the Kingdom is *greater and more closely related to Christ* than that of being wedded to the capital city.
>p. 40 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 1

>Let it be also understood, in all our remarks, that while advocating a literal city, we necessarily include, because the city is specially designed for them, the union of the saints with Jesus Christ, and their abiding with the King in this same city.
>p. 40 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 1

>... —*it does not follow* from the figure of marriage used, that the Church is the Bride here intended.
>p. 40 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 1

>Now the setting up of this Throne in it, *is the act of marriage*; it is that which makes the union.
>p. 43 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 2

>... *a place* to which the nations can go to honor and worship the King.
>p. 44 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 2

>... *a place* into which, and to which the righteous come, and *not* as the saints themselves.
>p. 44 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 2

>Now, while some of these prophetic announcements refer more particularly to that earthly portion of Jerusalem which will be rebuilt, yet it includes that portion (the new) which will be added to or joined with it.
>p. 44-45 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 2

>... But that the saints are not denoted, and that the reference is to a material city, is found in the fact that the saints are represented (Rev. 19:9) when the marriage (i.e. this setting up of the Theocratic Throne) takes place as *guests, the called or invited*, who enjoy the marriage supper, the feast that the prophets describe. They cannot be, in this case, the Guests and the Bride *at the same time*; ... believers are the invited guests, the called, who are virgins waiting for the Bridegroom and Bride, and who have on the wedding garment not as the Bride but *as guests* who now participate in and enjoy the unbounded blessings resulting from this splendidly restored *Theocratic enthronement in a city* prepared for the King.
>p. 45 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 2
### Immense size of the city
>Obs. 3. The immense size of the city forms in the minds of many *the most formidable objection* to the reception of the description as representative of a real, literal city.
>p. 47 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 3
### On the earth, at Jerusalem
>Obs. 4. The restoration of the Davidic throne and the occupation of it by David’s Son, necessarily includes the fact, so plainly predicted by the prophets, that when the Messiah comes to reign, He will set up His throne *at the same place* formerly occupied by David’s throne. This throne was not "*in the third heaven*” and not “*in the air above the earth*” but was located *on the earth, in Palestine, at Jerusalem*.
>p. 49 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 4

>The Theocratic relationship is not fully restored *without this feature*, and the inheritance of David’s Son is not possessed unless Zion’s hill *is again occupied by Him*.
>p. 49 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 4

>a strong and irresistible impression that the Old and New Jerusalem are *permanently united*; the one part specially designed for the King and the saints into which the kings of the earth, the representatives of the nations, enter, and the other part intended for the restored Jewish nation, as a kind of suburb or extension of the city embracing some of its subjects constantly living in the light and beholding the glory of the former.
>p. 50 Vol. 3 Prop. 169 Obs. 4

>the prophets, whom we endeavor to imitate, speak of them *as one*, sometimes describing one portion and then again the other, because of *the immediate close conjunction* existing between them, for the New is added as an addition, most glorious and suitable for such a David’s Son, to the Old, thus making it (Isa. 62:3, Hebrew) “*a diadem of a Kingdom*.”
