# Proposition 169. This Theocratic Kingdom embraces the marriage of Christ to the New Jerusalem.

>Our object under this heading is merely to show who the Bride is, and to explain what is meant by the marriage relation.
### Bride is the New Jerusalem
>Obs. 1. The Bride is the city New Jerusalem, for a city is in prophetical language, (as well as in that of other writers), personified by a woman or virgin.

Attempted interpretations of the New Jerusalem
1. figurative or symbolical representation of the Church
2. the risen and glorified saints
3. magnificent emblem of the future state -- including residence -- of the redeemed
4. a figurative representation of the Church
5. restored Eden or Paradise
6. the third heaven or a scene or place in heaven
7. renewed state of the Church
8. the national polity of the Jews during the millennium
9. a literal city

>Indeed the Church is (as we shall show hereafter) married, i.e. brought into intimate and endearing union with Christ, even in a higher and nobler sense than this city, inasmuch as a glorification after the pattern of Christ, and co-heirship with Him in the rulership, etc., of the Kingdom is greater and more closely related to Christ than that of being wedded to the capital city.

>Let it be also understood, in all our remarks, that while advocating a literal city, we necessarily include, because the city is specially designed for them, the union of the saints with Jesus Christ, and their abiding with the King in this same city.

>—it does not follow from the figure of marriage used, that the Church is the Bride here intended.

>Now the setting up of this Throne in it, is the act of marriage; it is that which makes the union.

>a place to which the nations can go to honor and worship the King.

>a place into which, and to which the righteous come, and not as the saints themselves.

>Now, while some of these prophetic announcements refer more particularly to that earthly portion of Jerusalem which will be rebuilt, yet it includes that portion (the new) which will be added to or joined with it.

>But that the saints are not denoted, and that the reference is to a material city, is found in the fact that the saints are represented (Rev. 19:9) when the marriage (i.e. this setting up of the Theocratic Throne) takes place as guests, the called or invited, who enjoy the marriage supper, the feast that the prophets describe. They cannot be, in this case, the Guests and the Bride at the same time;
>...
>believers are the invited guests, the called, who are virgins waiting for the Bridegroom and Bride, and who have on the wedding garment not as the Bride but as guests who now participate in and enjoy the unbounded blessings resulting from this splendidly restored Theocratic enthronement in a city prepared for the King.
### Immense size of the city
>Obs. 3. The immense size of the city forms in the minds of many the most formidable objection to the reception of the description as representative of a real, literal city.
### On the earth, at Jerusalem
>Obs. 4. The restoration of the Davidic throne and the occupation of it by David’s Son, necessarily includes the fact, so plainly predicted by the prophets, that when the Messiah comes to reign, He will set up His throne at the same place formerly occupied by David’s throne. This throne was not in the third heaven” and not “in the air above the earth” but was located on the earth, in Palestine, at Jerusalem.

>The Theocratic relationship is not fully restored without this feature, and the inheritance of David’s Son is not possessed unless Zion’s hill is again occupied by Him.

>a strong and irresistible impression that the Old and New Jerusalem are permanently united; the one part specially designed for the King and the saints into which the kings of the earth, the representatives of the nations, enter, and the other part intended for the restored Jewish nation, as a kind of suburb or extension of the city embracing some of its subjects constantly living in the light and beholding the glory of the former.

>the prophets, whom we endeavor to imitate, speak of them as one, sometimes describing one portion and then again the other, because of the immediate close conjunction existing between them, for the New is added as an addition, most glorious and suitable for such a David’s Son, to the Old, thus making it (Isa. 62:3, Hebrew) “a diadem of a Kingdom.”
