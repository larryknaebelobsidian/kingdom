>Our object under this heading is merely to show who the Bride is, and to explain what is meant by the marriage relation.

>Obs. 1. The Bride is the city New Jerusalem, for a city is in prophetical language, (as well as in that of other writers), personified by a woman or virgin.

Attempted interpretations
1. figurative or symbolical representation of the Church
2. the risen and glorified saints
3. magnificent emblem of the future state -- including residence -- of the redeemed
4. a figurative representation of the Church
5. restored Eden or Paradise
6. the third heaven or a scene or place in heaven
7. renewed state of the Church
8. the national polity of the Jews during the millennium
9. a literal city

>Indeed the Church is (as we shall show hereafter) married, i.e. brought into intimate and endearing union with Christ, even in a higher and nobler sense than this city, inasmuch as a glorification after the pattern of Christ, and co-heirship with Him in the rulership, etc., of the Kingdom is greater and more closely related to Christ than that of being wedded to the capital city.

>Let it be also understood, in all our remarks, that while advocating a literal city, we necessarily include, because the city is specially designed for them, the union of the saints with Jesus Christ, and their abiding with the King in this same city.

>â€”it does not follow from the figure of marriage used, that the Church is the Bride here intended.
