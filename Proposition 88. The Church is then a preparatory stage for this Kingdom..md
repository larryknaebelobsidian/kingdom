# Proposition 88. The Church is then a preparatory stage for this Kingdom.

>the inference is drawn that the wider such a separation is made, the better for true religion. Everything distinctively Jewish is to be sacrificed, giving place to a substituted Gentileism. This is especially true of the leading doctrine of the Kingdom; the Jewish view is denounced,, and a wide departure substituted as better adapted to the wisdom, standing, etc., of Gentiles. is preparatory, because its office is, under divine assistance, to gather out of the nations the elect, i.e. those who are grafted into the Jewish Commonwealth, who shall, by virtue of adoption as Abraham’s seed, be accounted heirs and inheritors of the Kingdom with Abraham. It is simply calling and preparing “the heirs of promise” the “heirs of that kingdom which God hath prepared for them that love Him.”

### Variety of attempts to elevate the church to the kingdom
>Obs. 1. Discarding the simple truth of the Proposition, eminent men of ability have arrayed themselves against each other, contending for some favorite church theory, manifesting an amazing variety of definitions, subtle divisions, imaginary distinctions, and irrelevant display of learning. This has resulted mainly from elevating the church into a Kingdom under the mistake that this dispensation being final, and the prophecies locating the Messiah’s Kingdom here on earth, the church *must of necessity be like predicted Kingdom*.
>p. 592 Vol. 1 Prop. 88 Obs. 1
### The church is never directly called the kingdom in the scriptures
>Obs. 2. If we are wrong in this, and other Propositions linked with it, it can be easily decided against us by producing a passage where the church is *directly* called a Kingdom. A due examination will reveal the fact that *no such Scripture* can be found.
>p. 592 Vol. 1 Prop. 88 Obs. 2

>The Origenistic interpretation, so destructive to early Millenarianism, appeared as *the patron and champion* of this inference, until under its widespread influence, the inference was changed into a supposed axiomatic truth. Being also in the line of ambition, etc., it was tenaciously held by all who were favorable to hierarchical tendencies, and any who rejected it as inference and assumption were regarded as heretics. Indeed even now, it is *so deeply imbedded* in religious belief and system, that to call it by its true name, *a mere inference*, is to excite prejudice, bitterness and wrath in the hearts of some who *profess* to love the truth for the truth’s sake.
>p. 593 Vol. 1 Prop. 88 Obs. 2
### Proof that the church is the kingdom will resolve the issue
>Obs. 3. We are not surprised that the result just mentioned should follow, for if it can be shown that the covenanted Kingdom is *something different* from the church; that the Kingdom is held in postponement until a certain predetermined number of elect are gathered; that the church is appointed to gather and cherish these elect, and hence is *preparatory* in its action, *then* this view of the Kingdom, showing that the church’s relation to this Kingdom is *a subordinate and. preparatory one, prepares us to appreciate* the claims of Popery, Puseyism, hierarchical tendencies, nationalizing churches, and a host of similar *exclusive* demands put on faith and practice, all of which are founded on *the assumption* that the church is *not preparatory to the predicted* Kingdom, but is in truth *the covenanted Kingdom itself* Our doctrine is *too humiliating* for such, and *therefore* fails of acceptance.
>p. 593 Vol. 1 Prop. 88 Obs. 3
### Wrong view leads to published antagonistic notions
>Obs. 4. As stated, it is owing to the view taken of this Kingdom, that such *widely antagonistic* notions are published respecting the church.
>p. 593 Vol. 1 Prop. 88 Obs. 4
### A battlefield
>Obs. 5. The Romanist and the Protestant have made the question of the church a battle-field, in which many a past strife is noted by history.
>p. 594 Vol. 1 Prop. 88 Obs. 5 
### Seeking exact agreement in church govt.
>Obs. 6. Many, impelled by the idea that if the church is a Kingdom there ought, of necessity, to be a *unity*, have sought for this in various ways —in an outward union of believers, in an exact agreement of doctrine, in some form of church government, etc.
>p. 594 Vol. 1 Prop. 88 Obs. 6
### EKKLESIA - designedly chosen word
>Obs. 7. It is our deep conviction that the word *ekklesia*, translated church, was *designedly* chosen to express what the church really means.
>p. 594 Vol. 1 Prop. 88 Obs. 7

>Let the reader notice how we have shown that to raise up a seed unto Abraham certain elect, those of like faith unto Abraham, are *chosen out of* the nations. The word therefore, *ek*, out of, and *kaleo*, I call, denotes *to call out of*, and hence means precisely what the Apostles in Council, Acts 15:14, denominated its object to be, viz.: *to call out from among the nations a people*, etc. Why was the word rendered church chosen in place of the more familiar one synagogue, unless it be that the former more explicitly expresses the idea intended? (Vide Prop. 175, and Comp. Hagenbach's *His. Doc.*, vol. 1, p. 194)
