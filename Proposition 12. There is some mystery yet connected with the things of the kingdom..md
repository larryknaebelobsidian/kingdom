>This is seen, e.g. in Rev. 10:7, where it is declared that under the last period of time in this age, “the mystery of God should be finished” which commentators generally apply to the fulfilment of the Divine Purpose in the setting up of the kingdom in a manner that shall be universally acknowledged, in vindicating through its establishment the Divine plan, etc. It indicates that some things hitherto kept concealed or partially known, should now be revealed or openly manifested, whatever meaning is attached to the passage, it leaves the impression that not everything pertaining to the kingdom is yet fully known.
### Multifaceted aspects of mystery
>Obs. 1. Men who have given the subject much thought, have the idea that the mystery here stated mainly refers to the period, not definitely known, for the outward manifestation of the kingdom, but it may, for aught we know, include much more. While the mystery 
>1. does not allude to the nature of the kingdom (for this, as will be shown hereafter, is explained), 
>2. it suggests the comparative unknown time for its glorious establishment, 
>3. the events connected with it of which only broken hints are given, 
>4. the occurrence of things not revealed, and 
>5. the manner in which things revealed shall be accomplished.

### Definition
>Obs. 2. The word “mystery,” according to Fairbairn (On Proph., p. 372), “in the quite uniform usage of Scripture, denotes something which lies beyond the ken of the natural apprehension, and is revealed only to such as have the mind and spirit of God. So it is used frequently by the Apostle Paul, Rom. 16:25, 1 Cor. 2:7, 10, etc.”
### Many writers acknowledge mysteries
>Obs. 3. A multitude of writers attest to the existence of mysteries, their necessity, their value, and usefulness; and correctly affirm, that without them a decided proof of the Divine origin of the Bible would be lacking, a sublime display of Divine perfection would be wanting, and that the scope for faith, hope, reverence, humility, etc., would be seriously narrowed.
### Must apply to the Scriptures
>Obs. 4. The doctrine of the Kingdom thus containing mysteries, confirms the position taken, that to its proper understanding, we must apply to the Scriptures, and seek within its limits for the things appertaining to it, Props. 9, and 10.
### Objections are more from heart than head
>Obs. 5. It is difficult to satisfy the cavils of unbelief on this point, seeing that the most opposite objections are urged against mysteries. The manner in which they are presented, indicate that they come more from the heart (i.e. are desired) than from the head (i.e. intelligently based)..
### Unbelievers inconsistent in treatment of mysteries
>Obs. 6. It is a strange fact, that unbelievers of the past and present, who reject the mysteries of the Bible, call upon us to accept of the incomprehensible, the mysterious, the hypothetical in their several theories.
