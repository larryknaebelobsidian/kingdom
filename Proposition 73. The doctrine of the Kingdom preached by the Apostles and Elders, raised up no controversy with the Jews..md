# Proposition 73. The doctrine of the Kingdom preached by the Apostles and Elders, raised up no controversy with the Jews.

>Neither in the New Test, nor in any of the Patristic writings, do we find the least hint given that the doctrine of the Kingdom excited any controversy with the Jews; which it undoubtedly would have done if antagonistic to the Jewish view. This is strong, corroborative evidence that the doctrine was in accordance with the Jewish Messianic expectations.
### Jews (who believed in the kingdom) were the first converts
>Obs. 1. Jews, indoctrinated into the covenants, were the first converts, and, with their faith, it would have been utterly impracticable to have influenced them to receive Jesus as “the Messiah,” unless it was understood that these covenants were at some time in the future to be realized through Him.
### Effect on conversions of the Jews over time
>Obs. 2. Consider 
>1. (1) how large numbers of the Jews were converted to Christianity, accepting of Jesus as “the Messiah,” because of the fact that they were led to believe (a) that at the Sec. Advent the glorious predicted Messianic Kingdom would be established, and (b) that the life and death of Jesus (His resurrection and exaltation included), evinced Him as pre-eminently qualified to be “the Messiah” and as possessing the requisite power to fulfil the covenant promises. 
>2. (2) How, as the early doctrine became obscured, substituted, and finally driven from the field, the conversions of the Jews became rarer and almost entirely ceased, excepting such as were produced under compulsion. How else account for so great a change, unless it be in the gradual engrafting of other than Jewish ideas to the Messiahship of Jesus, making the Messiah less and less in correspondence with the Messiah of the Old Test Scriptures?

### Used as means of persecution
>Obs. 3. The early Jews, instead of accusing Christians of rejecting such a Kingdom, charged the primitive believers with entertaining such a view, and sought to bring them, on account of the same, into difficulties with the Roman Emperors.
### No apostolic argument with Jews over the kingdom
>Obs. 4. This, again, is sustained by the apostles’ argumentation with the Jews. Aside from the usage of Jewish phraseology, without explaining it as moderns do; apart from the action of the apostles in Council (Acts 15), which cannot be made to accord with the later notions of the Kingdom; —it is found that the apostles never were compelled to combat the Jewish idea of the Messiah, or of the Kingdom. We nave a noted instance of this in Paul, who disputed with the Jews (e.g. Acts 28:17-29), “expounded and testified the Kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets.” He speaks of “the hope of Israel“preaching the Kingdom of God,” and never once intimates that the Jews were mistaken in their views of the Kingdom as derived from the Covenant. The dispute (as we find e.g. Acts 26:1-23) was not concerning the Kingdom, but respected “Jesus of Nazareth,” whether He indeed be the Messiah.
