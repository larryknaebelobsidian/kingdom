# Proposition 178. This doctrine of the Kingdom, and its essentially related subjects, are so hostile to their faith, that numerous organized religious bodies totally reject them.
### Millenarians relatively small minority
>Obs. 1. While in the aggregate Pre-Millenarians form a respectable body, and are found (as e.g. evidenced in the Proph. Conferences in England and America) in various denominations, yet in comparison with the immense body which rejects our doctrine they form a small minority, thus according with the Spirit’s prediction.
### Waiting posture ignored by ecclesiastical bodies
>Obs. 3. Ecclesiastical bodies in their general meetings totally ignore the commanded posture of watching.
### The focus on money and endowments
>Obs. 4. One feature alone evidences the spirit and aim of the Church, and that is the endowment system so largely adopted by individual congregations, synodical bodies, religions organizations, etc. Investments in real estate, mortgages, bonds, and stocks are made in a manner so declarative of perpetuity, of the Lord delaying His Coming, of faith in the conversion of the world, etc., that it manifests a wide departure from the scriptural injunction and the primitive belief.
### An interdicted subject
>Obs. 5. In many of our congregations this doctrine is an interdicted subject (as the writer knows from personal observation and experience), and what a writer (Proph. Times, vol. G, p. 176) confessed, many can truthfully declare: “Although trained and educated in the—Church, I know no more about the Second Coming of Christ and His reign on the earth, than a heathen in the jungles of India knows of the story of the Cross.” Indeed such regard the doctrine as fanaticism and heresy, and do not desire their pulpits to announce the warnings of Jesus, or to exhibit the primitive faith and its scriptural foundations.
### The religious press against us
>Obs. 6. The religious press, which has such a powerful denominational influence, is almost en masse against us.
### Spirit of unbelief and opposition
>Obs. 7. The mass of the Church, both in ministry and laity, is so leavened with the spirit of unbelief and opposition, that threats of excommunication, deposal, etc., are boldly announced, notwithstanding the antiquity, antecedents, reception, scriptural foundation of the doctrine.
### Our doctrine dismissed by some who are pious and useful laborers
>Obs. 8. The faith of multitudes is influenced by that expressed by pious and useful laborers of the Church, and when our doctrine—which evidently has never been studied, either in its historical or scriptural aspects—is curtly dismissed by them as unworthy of credence or attention, the reputation, the godly life of such sways many to treat it with indifference and even with contempt.
### Church literature does not teach
>Indeed, it is a fact that many are so familiarized to such a “Church Literature,” that they are utterly unacquainted with our doctrines, and the scriptural reasons assigned in their behalf.
>Obs. 9
### Delay of His return sinks some into apathy and unbelief
>these expectations and data passed by without His return, and many, because of the non-fulfilment, remain sunken in a state of apathy and unbelief—just as if the event depended on man’s estimate or measuring of time, and not on God’s own appointment.
>Obs. 10
### God is testing the church
>Obs. 12. It may probably be asked, Why is it that God allows so many prophets to arise and predict “peace and safety,” and make the Church, as a body, complacently look forward to continued prosperity, increased wealth and power, and wide extended dominion? The reason was long ago assigned by Moses (Deut. 13:3) in the words: “for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.” It is done to test the love of His people, to discriminate between those who reverently receive all that He has spoken and honor His Son, and those who will follow the views and doctrines of men, giving the honor which exclusively belongs to the Son’s work to men. When persons wilfully ignore oath-bound covenants, ridicule “the Blessed Hope,” even the Coming of Jesus, and mock at the inheritance of Jesus and His saints, then it is but just that they should put their trust in smooth but false predictions instead of the Word of God.
