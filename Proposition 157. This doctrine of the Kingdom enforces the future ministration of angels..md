# Proposition 157. This doctrine of the Kingdom enforces the future ministration of angels.

>Believers now by faith come “*to an innumerable company of angels*” (Heb. 12:22, or “to myriads of angels in an assembly or joyful convocation,” Barnes, *Com. loci*). These angels were employed preparatory to the Theocracy, at the introduction of the Theocracy, etc., and it is most reasonable to believe, as taught, that they will continue to be interested in, and engaged in behalf of, the Theocracy when gloriously restored.
>p. 618 Vol. 2 Prop. 157
### Supremacy over all angels
>Obs. 1. The supremacy and exaltation of Jesus, the Christ, over all angels (Col. 1:16; Eph. 1:21; 1 Pet. 3:22), their attendance on and service to Him at the First Advent (Luke 2:9-14; Matt. 4:11; Luke 22:43, etc.), their deep interest in things pertaining to Him (e.g. Eph. 3:10, 11; 1 Pet. 1:12, etc.), their connection with the events of the Sec. Advent (Matt. 16:21; Luke 12:8, 9, etc.), their worship of Him (Heb. 1:6; Rev. 5:11, 12), His power over them (Matt. 26:51, 52; Heb. 1:4, etc.)—these, as well as other considerations, show that at the restoration of the Theocracy, the Messiah shall swell His glory by that of the angelic host. Now let the student but observe the relationship that “the first-born,” “the first-fruits” sustain to Christ, and he will clearly see that this body obtain, in virtue of their union with Jesus *as coheirs, a power* over angels.
>p. 618 Vol. 2 Prop. 157 Obs. 1
### Angels ascending, descending upon the Son of man
>Obs. 2. In the future will be verified Christ’s promise to Nathaniel, Jno. 1:51, “*Verily, verily, I say unto you,: Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.*”
>...
>This wonderful commingling (foreshadowed by Jacob’s dream, Gen. 28:12) of the heavenly host with the Son of man and His associates in their glory, implies a continued ministration.
>...
>The angelic ministration witnesses to the fact that “*the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them*.
>p. 618-619 Vol. 2 Prop. 157 Obs. 2
### Witness to all aspects of salvation
>Obs. 3. Angels represented as the highest and noblest of beings, having access to the presence (“face”) of God, care for believers (Matt. 18:10) and, in virtue of the present and future of the repenting one, rejoice at the conversion of the sinner (Luke 15:10); they witness the struggles of our pilgrimage (1 Tim. 5:21; 1 Cor. 4:9 and 11:10), and they are fellow-servants of the prophets and apostles as manifested in their employment for the good of God’s people, and in bringing directions and revelations of God’s will (Gen. 19:15,19 and 22:11; Acts 5:19, 20; Dan. 8:17, 19; Acts 8:26 and 10:3, etc.).
>p. 619 Vol. 2 Prop. 157 Obs. 3
### Judge angels
>Obs. 4. To be “as the angels of God in heaven” (Matt. 22:30), or to be “equal unto the angels” (Luke 20:36) may, as the context seems to indicate, only refer to the mode of existence (i.e. in reference to marriage, happiness, and immortality), but there is one passage which distinctly teaches a certain pre-eminency over, at least, some of the angels. In 1 Cor. 6:3 we read: “*Know ye not that we shall judge angels?*” which evidently means ruling over angels, just as “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?” indicates clearly a ruling over the world.
>p. 620 Vol. 2 Prop. 157 Obs. 4
### Involvement in world governments
>Obs. 5. In Dan. 10:13, 20; Heb. 2:5 it is intimated that angels are concerned in the present government of the world.
>p. 620 Vol. 2 Prop. 157 Obs. 5
### Blessed future fellowship with angels
>Obs. 6. One of the blessed ingredients of future happiness and glory will be *the intercourse* of the glorified saints with the angelic host. This will prove a never-ending source of blissful enjoyment. To converse with those who witnessed creation, who have been the trusted messengers of God in countless missions of mercy and love, who for ages have had the honor and glory of God at heart, who are so exalted in knowledge, wisdom, and power —this will be a privilege indeed.
