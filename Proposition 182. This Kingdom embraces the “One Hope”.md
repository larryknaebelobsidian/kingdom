>Our argument presents the “One Hope” (Eph. 4:4), that actuated the ancient worthies, the pious Jews at the First Advent, the disciples, apostles, and early believers, and many an humble believer down to the present day. This hope is continuously expressed not only in this, but in the preceding dispensation. Abraham “believed in hope” (Rom. 4:18) and so do his seed; a hope expressed in the covenants, reiterated by the prophets, renewed by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and preached by the apostles; a hope centred in God (Jer. 14:8 and 17:7, 13, etc.), manifested in Jesus (1 Tim. 1:1; Col. 1:27; 1 Thess. 1:2, 3, etc.), and wrought by the Spirit (Rom. 15:13).

>Obs. 1. Much vagueness exists among believers at the present day in reference to this Hope, owing to the simple fact that the announcement of this Hope (as e.g. by the angel, Luke 1:32, 33) is spiritualized or explained away, and something else substituted in its place.

>A portion of the Hope (also called Hope because firmly attached to it, as e.g. the resurrection, eternal life, etc.) must not be mistaken for the whole Hope.
