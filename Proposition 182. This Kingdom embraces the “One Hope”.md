# Proposition 182. This Kingdom embraces the “One Hope”

>Our argument presents the “One Hope” (Eph. 4:4), that actuated the ancient worthies, the pious Jews at the First Advent, the disciples, apostles, and early believers, and many an humble believer down to the present day. This hope is continuously expressed not only in this, but in the preceding dispensation. Abraham “believed in hope” (Rom. 4:18) and so do his seed; a hope expressed in the covenants, reiterated by the prophets, renewed by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and preached by the apostles; a hope centred in God (Jer. 14:8 and 17:7, 13, etc.), manifested in Jesus (1 Tim. 1:1; Col. 1:27; 1 Thess. 1:2, 3, etc.), and wrought by the Spirit (Rom. 15:13).
### Vagueness about the "One Hope"
>Obs. 1. Much vagueness exists among believers at the present day in reference to this Hope, owing to the simple fact that the announcement of this Hope (as e.g. by the angel, Luke 1:32, 33) is spiritualized or explained away, and something else substituted in its place.

>A portion of the Hope (also called Hope because firmly attached to it, as e.g. the resurrection, eternal life, etc.) must not be mistaken for the whole Hope.
>Obs. 1

>this is pre-eminently a Jewish Hope, i.e. a Hope connected with the Jewish nation, through covenants given to the Jews and through a King appertaining to them.
>Obs. 1

>Our Hope is “the Hope of Israel” (Acts 28:20), the Hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers, unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come” (Acts 26:6, 7).
### Held by Primitive Church but then changed to another hope
>Obs. 2. If we are to credit a multitude of writers, this “One Hope” so long entertained by God’s ancient people, and which formed so remarkable a feature of the Primitive Church, and for which believers suffered even death, was changed to another Hope.
### Some make it a secondary matter
>Obs. 4. Some turn from “the Blessed Hope,” the appearing of Jesus, and make it a secondary matter, putting death in its place. But the Bible reverses all this, making the Sec. Coming with its glory the primary thing and death a subsidiary affair.
### Second Advent topic occupies 1/25 of the NT
>In reference to the Sec. Advent, Brookes (Bible Readings) says: “It is mentioned 318 times in the 260 chapters that make up the New Test., or if the whole book is divided into verses, it occupies one of twenty-five verses from the first of Matthew to the last of Revelation.”
>Obs. 6
### Characteristic of a true Christian
>It is one of the characteristics of a true Christian that he sincerely desires the return of his Saviour, and would welcome His appearing in the clouds of heaven.”
>Obs. 7

>“The true Christian does not dread the Coming of that day. He looks forward to it as the period of His redemption, and would welcome, at any time, the return of his Lord and Saviour. While he is willing to wait as long as it shall please God for the Advent of His Redeemer, yet to Him the brightest prospect in the future is that hour when He shall come to take him to Himself.”
