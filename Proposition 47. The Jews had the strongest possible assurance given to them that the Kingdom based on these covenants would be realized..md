# Proposition 47. The Jews had the strongest possible assurance given to them that the Kingdom based on these covenants would be realized.

>Attention has already been directed (Prop. 18) to the fact that the prophecies pertaining to this Kingdom shall not, in their ultimate fulfilment, fail, i.e., they are unconditional. The reason for this is that they are evolved from covenants confirmed by oath; and hence, in view of their absolute certainty (no matter how postponed), God has given expression to language which affirms beyond any doubt that this Kingdom, sustaining a covenanted relationship, would at some time in the future be established; and this, too, as covenanted in connection with the national salvation of the Jewish nation. Thus, e.g., read Jer. 31:36-37, and 33:19-26; Isa. 54:9, 10, etc.
>p. 287 Vol. 1 Prop. 47

### Jeremiah 31:36-37
“If these statutes are removed 
From before Me,” declares Yahweh,
“Then the seed of Israel also will cease
From being a nation before Me forever.”
37 Thus says Yahweh,
“If the heavens above can be measured
And the foundations of the earth searched out below,
Then I will also reject all the seed of Israel
For all that they have done,” declares Yahweh. - LSB

### Jeremiah 33:19-26
Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 20 “Thus says Yahweh, ‘If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night will not be at their appointed time, 21 then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers. 22 As the host of heaven cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.’” 23 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 24 “Have you not seen what this people have spoken, saying, ‘The two families which Yahweh chose, He has rejected them’? Thus they have spurned My people from being a nation any longer in their sight. 25 Thus says Yahweh, ‘If My covenant _for_ day and night _stand_ not, _and_ the statutes for heaven and earth I have not established, 26 then I would reject the seed of Jacob and David My servant, not taking from his seed rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But I will return their fortunes and will have compassion on them.’” - LSB

### Isaiah 54:9,10
“For this is like the days of Noah to Me,
When I swore that the waters of Noah
Would not overflow the earth again;
So I have sworn that I will not be furious with you
Nor will I rebuke you.
10 For the mountains may be removed and the hills may shake,
But My lovingkindness will not be removed from you,
And My covenant of peace will not be shaken,”
Says Yahweh who has compassion on you. - LSB
### Jews were correct
>Obs. 1. Hence it follows: that the Jews were not so grossly ignorant as many Gentiles now think; that they were correct in their apprehensions concerning the Messiah’s Kingdom being identified with the restored Davidic.
>...
>God will perform the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, and the Prophets, respecting the Jewish nation.
### View of the pre-First Advent pious
>Obs. 2. Let the reader place himself in the period before the First Advent, with the Old Test, in his hands. Now what would be his belief in the Kingdom, with those covenants and prophecies, confirmed by oath and most expressive assurances? Surely it would be identical with that of the Jews themselves; it could not be otherwise, if there was faith in God’s Word and God’s oath.
### In spite of the unbelief of some modern Jews
>Obs. 3. The attitude of a portion of the modern Jews is to be regretted. Leavened with infidelity, they have lost all faith in the most precise and determinate utterances that can indicate the determination of God to verify His promises to the nation, and yet they profess to believe in this same God, in His veracity, etc.
>...
>(Lev. 26:44), “Yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God.” Whether they believe it or not, mercy follows them for the sake of the covenant, and mercy will yet verify that covenant in the history of the nation, for “their God” has sworn it.
### Some writers push false "historical criticism"
>Obs. 4. A class of writers has arisen, who, professing to be very critical, tell us that Abraham’s life, and indeed the whole Bible, must be subjected to “Historical Criticism.”
>...
>To this class, the solemnly covenanted promises of God and the assurances respecting the Kingdom are all idle dreams; men who believe and trust in them are self-deceived and fanatical; history that corroborates prophetic announcements is merely a coincidence; the faith of ages, sustained by personal experience and Providence, is nothing but a mistaken belief.
