>This might be shown by numerous references, but it will be sufficiently conspicuous by adverting to the declarations found in only one chapter of the New Testament. Thus, e.g., Luke 1:32, 33, 55, 72, 73, where we have undoubted allusions to previously obtained covenants, in “the mercy promised to the fathers,” in “the holy covenant” confirmed by’ oath “to our father Abraham,” and in “the throne of his father David.”

## Luke 1:32, 33
He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David, 33 and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of His kingdom.”

## Luke 1:55
As He spoke to our fathers,
To Abraham and his seed forever.”

## Luke 1:72, 73
72 To show mercy toward our fathers,
And to remember His holy covenant,
73 The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,
### Abrahamic covenant is the foundation
>Kurtz (His. Old Cov. p. 175) has well expressed this “a foundation on which the great Salvation is ultimately to appear.” Thorp (The Dest. of the Brit. Empire, Pref., p. 8) justly observes: “The Abrahamic Covenant is the foundation of all the dispensations of heaven, both to Jews and Gentiles.”
>Obs. 1
### Caution over slicing up the covenants
>Obs. 2. Let it be observed that in approaching the covenants we are not at liberty to receive one and reject another, nor are we authorized to take just as much as may suit our Theological views out of one and refuse to believe in the rest. Here is where many Theological writings make the fatal mistake: they are willing to receive the Abrahamic covenant as a perpetual one, but not the Davidic, when the same perpetuity is asserted of both; they are agreed to receive part of the Abrahamic, or part of the Davidic covenant, but not all that is written. No wonder that a diversity is thus produced, and an antagonism to the Old Test. The Jews and the Primitive Church were far more logical and scriptural when they cordially received those covenants and believed in God’s statements concerning them. The trouble at present is, that the church, with all her professions, has too little faith.
>p. 285-286 Vol. 1 Prop. 46 Obs. 2
### Efforts to undermine the force of the covenants
>Obs. 3. Approaching the covenants and seeing how they form great central points around which successive revelations cluster—yea, the foundation stones upon which the Christological structure is erected—we are not surprised at the efforts made to undermine their force, either by separating the Old from the New Test, as antiquated, or by elevating the New far above the Old as only worthy of reception, or by a rejection of the Old as not authentic, etc.
### Early church prominence
>Obs. 4. The Abrahamic and Davidic covenants were very prominently held by the early church, as can be readily seen by the general use made of them, illustrated, e.g. in the Epistle of Barnabas, the writings of Irenaeus, Justin, Tertullian, etc.
