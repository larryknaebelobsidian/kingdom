> The Theocracy, which had typical and ceremonial observances, as Paul teaches, that were to be removed in Christ, had a form of government which, prophecy instructs us, is to be fully exhibited in all its beauty and excellency under the Messiah, the great Jewish king, Davidâ€™s son.
> p. 216 Vol. 1 Prop. 25

> Provisionary in some of its aspects, the Theocracy still possessed *the essential elements* of God's Kingdom, and gave an earnest only of what God intends.  It was a form of government under the sole, *accessible Headship* of God Himself (Deut. 5, etc.). He was the Supreme Lawgiver in *civil and religious* affairs (Deut. 4:12 and 12:32), and when difficult cases required it (Deut. 17:8-13), the Divine Arbiter or Judge.  In brief, the *legislative, executive, and judicial* power was vested in Him, and partially delegated to others, to be exercised under a restricted form (Deut. 16:18, etc.). All the people (Deut. 29:10-13), in their *civil, religious, social, and family* relations, were to acknowledge, and be obedient to His expressed will. He communicated His will according to an ordained manner, and when not declared, or where there was doubt, the princes or leaders could come for inquiry and receive specific directions. As an indication and reminder of this Supremacy, all the people were required at certain times in the year (Deut. 16:16, etc.) to visit the place of special manifestation, and renew their vows of allegiance. The prophets (e.g. Isa. 1:21-24) spoke for God to the highest and lowest, and their rebukes were in the name of the Supreme Head.  M'Clintock and Strong's *Cyclop.*, Art. "Monarchy, Israelitish," says: "According to the sense of the Mosaic constitution, the Hebrews were erected into a kind of republic under *the immediate dominion of Jehovah, forming a strict theocracy*". Fairbairn (*Typology*, vol. 2, p. 391) gives as the true idea, and distinctive nature of a Theocracy, "*the formal exhibition of God as King, or Supreme Head of the Commonwealth*; so that all authority and law emanated from Him, and, by necessary consequence, there were not two societies in the ordinary sense, civil and religious, but *a fusion of the two into one body*" (comp. his able article on "The Jewish Theocracy" and Locke's definition in "Treat. on Toleration").

> Theocracy is *a government of the State by the immediate direction* of God; Jehovah condescended to reign over Israel in *the same direct manner* in which an earthly king reigns over his people.

> With wisdom worthy of Himself, He assumed not merely *a religious*, but *a political*, superiority, over the descendants of Abraham; He constituted Himself, *in the strictest sense* of the phrase, *King of Israel*, and the government of Israel became, in consequence, strictly and literally, *a Theocracy.*
