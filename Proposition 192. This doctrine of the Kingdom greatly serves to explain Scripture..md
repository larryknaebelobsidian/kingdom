# Proposition 192. This doctrine of the Kingdom greatly serves to explain Scripture.

>This results from the fact that being a *leading* doctrine of the Bible and embracing the great *end* contemplated, it must *necessarily* serve to interpret passages that are indistinct, obscure, and ambiguous. And this it does without straining such passages into a forced compatibility with the general tenor of Revelation concerning the Kingdom, but by simply allowing the plain grammatical sense to connect itself naturally with the comprehensive knowledge respecting the ordering of the Messianic Kingdom.
>p. 388 Vol. 3 Prop. 192

### Simple promises are clarified
#### Matt. 7:33
#### Psalm 23

>Thus a variety of promises receive a deeper significancy and assurance of perfect fulfilment when considered as standing related to this Kingdom.
#### John 14:12-14

#### John 16:23-24
### Grand conception and power becomes noticeable
>Obs. 2. An aptness of description, grand in conception and power, is noticeable in various predictions, provided the time of fulfilment is carefully observed.

#### Ps. 93, 90, 97, 98, 99, 100, etc.

>if they are located at the period intended by the Spirit and connected with the last culminating outbreak of depraved humanity in open rebellion against the Divine Theocratic ordering (willingly entered into by man), then the propriety and depth of such predictions can be realized. So, in the same way, all those passages referring to the coming wrath of the Lamb are to be understood.
>Obs. 2

### Hab. 3 - "the most sublime in language"
>the Jews regarded this as a prediction relating to the Coming of the Messiah,
>Obs. 3
### Aids explaining difficult passages
>Obs. 4. The doctrine of the Kingdom not only serves to explain what otherwise would be inexplicable (as e. g. the Married and Barren Woman, Prop. 118, references to the morning, Prop. 130, etc.), but aids materially in confirming renderings of the Scripture not correctly given in our version, in explaining the meaning of Scripture phraseology, and in interpreting passages upon which a variety of opinions

### Balaam's prophecy
>Obs. 5. Balaam’s prophecy,
>. . .
>it was eminently fitting for one outside of the nation to predict the irresistible power of the Theocracy and the certain overthrow of its enemies.

>Balaam’s prediction, coming when the first confederation arises against the Theocracy, directs the eye of faith onward to the time when the last great confederation shall be broken by the Theocratic.King.
>Obs. 5

### Confirms scriptural prophecies
>Obs. 6. This doctrine of the Kingdom confirms the already overpowering reasons given for the retention and inspiration of the later prophecies of Isaiah, seeing that they form a consistent outgrowth of covenant and promise, incorporating precisely that which is requisite to carry out the Theocratic ordering in the Redemption of the world.


>In brief, it is the testimony of every one who has given this subject any careful study, that it is such “a solvent of difficulties” that its application has given great joy of heart and delighted surprise in discovering the import of passages which otherwise proved either to be unsatisfactory or dark.
>Obs. 6

>our doctrine removes difficulties, as in the promises of inheriting and possessing the earth, in the parables, in the resurrection, in the renewal of creation, in the scene described by Matt. 25:31-46 (viz., in the ground of approval and of condemnation—for instead of the heart, the motives being examined, external, outward deeds are considered, etc.), in watching for the Advent, and in the wonderful results of Redemption, culminating in the salvation of the race as a race.
>Obs. 6

### Aids in our understanding of the early fathers of the church
>Obs. 7. This doctrine also aids in our understanding the allusions and language of the early Fathers of the Church.
