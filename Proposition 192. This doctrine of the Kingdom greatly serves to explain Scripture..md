# Proposition 192. This doctrine of the Kingdom greatly serves to explain Scripture.

### Props Mentioned
24 68 82 83 96 97 98 99 100 111 112 113 114 115 121 122 123 125-129 126 131 132 133 139 140 142 152 154 161 162 163 166 174

>This results from the fact that being a *leading* doctrine of the Bible and embracing the great *end* contemplated, it must *necessarily* serve to interpret passages that are indistinct, obscure, and ambiguous. And this it does without straining such passages into a forced compatibility with the general tenor of Revelation concerning the Kingdom, but by simply allowing the plain grammatical sense to connect itself naturally with the comprehensive knowledge respecting the ordering of the Messianic Kingdom.
>p. 388 Vol. 3 Prop. 192

### Simple promises are clarified
#### Matt. 6:33
Note: Book has a typo here. Book shows 7:33 but then quotes 6:33.

6:33 But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. (LSB)
#### Psalm 23

>Thus a variety of promises receive a deeper significancy and assurance of perfect fulfilment when considered as standing related to this Kingdom.
>p. 390 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 1
### Grand conception and power becomes noticeable
>Obs. 2. An aptness of description, grand in conception and power, is noticeable in various predictions, provided *the time* of fulfilment is carefully observed.
>p. 391 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 2

#### Ps. 93, 90, 97, 98, 99, 100, etc.

>... if they are located *at the period* intended by the Spirit and connected with the last culminating outbreak of depraved humanity in open rebellion against the Divine Theocratic ordering (willingly entered into by man), *then the propriety and depth* of such predictions can be realized. So, in the same way, all those passages referring to the coming wrath of the Lamb are to be understood.
>p. 391 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 2
### Hab. 3 - "the most sublime in language"
>... the Jews regarded this as a prediction relating to *the Coming of the Messiah*, ...
>p. 392 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 3
### Aids explaining difficult passages
>Obs. 4. The doctrine of the Kingdom not only serves to explain what otherwise would be inexplicable (as e. g. the Married and Barren Woman, Prop. 118, references to the morning, Prop. 130, etc.), but aids materially in confirming renderings of the Scripture not correctly given in our version, in explaining the meaning of *Scripture phraseology*, and in interpreting passages upon which a variety of opinions have been offered.
>p. 398 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 3
### Balaam's prophecy
>Obs. 5. Balaam’s prophecy,
>. . .
>it was *eminently fitting* for one outside of the nation to predict the irresistible power of the Theocracy and the certain overthrow of its enemies. Hence the repetition of it, enforces the idea of its certainty to conquer—however long delayed—all opposition. The remarkable part of the prophecy is, that, aside from the general affirmation bearing upon this point, it even passes from the present—as if foreseeing the downfall of the Theocracy and the miserable condition of the nation for centuries, and yet not allowing the mouth of an enemy to proclaim it—*to the far distant future*, and enters into details respecting the triumphant Theocracy *then established* with this same elect people who then shall overcome a still more formidable confederation, etc. It will richly repay us to direct our attention to portions of the prophecy illustrative of this passing from the present to the future, —from the existing Theocratic ordering *to that of the future one* under the Messiah—for it will confirm the arguments adduced by Kurtz, Hengstenberg, Newton, and many others, in favor of its *Messianic character*.
>p. 401 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 5

>Balaam’s prediction, coming when *the first confederation* arises against the Theocracy, directs the eye of faith onward to the time when *the last great confederation* shall be broken by the Theocratic King.
>p. 404 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 5
### Confirms scriptural prophecies
>Obs. 6. This doctrine of the Kingdom confirms the already overpowering reasons given for the retention and inspiration of *the later prophecies of Isaiah*, seeing that they form a *consistent outgrowth* of covenant and promise, incorporating precisely that which is requisite to carry out the Theocratic ordering in the Redemption of the world.
>p. 405 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 6

>In brief, it is the testimony of every one who has given this subject any careful study, that it is such “*a solvent of difficulties*” that its application has given great joy of heart and delighted surprise in discovering the import of passages which otherwise proved either to be unsatisfactory or dark.
>p. 406 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 6

>... our doctrine removes difficulties, as in the promises of inheriting and possessing the earth, in the parables, in the resurrection, in the renewal of creation, in the scene described by Matt. 25:31-46 (viz., in the ground of approval and of condemnation—for instead of the heart, the motives being examined, external, outward deeds are considered, etc.), in watching for the Advent, and in the wonderful results of Redemption, culminating in the salvation of the race as a race.
>p. 406 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 6
### Aids in our understanding of the early fathers of the church
>Obs. 7. This doctrine also aids in our understanding *the allusions and language* of the early Fathers of the Church.
>p. 406 Vol. 3 Prop. 192 Obs. 7
