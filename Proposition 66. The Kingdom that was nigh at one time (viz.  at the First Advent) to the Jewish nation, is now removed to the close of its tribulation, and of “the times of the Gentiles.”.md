>Let us again refer to Luke 21:31, in which it is stated “*when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand*.” Now among “these things” which are *first* to happen are the Jewish tribulation and “the times of the Gentiles” (v. 24), and when these come to pass, and Jerusalem is no longer under Gentile dominion, and the Advent (v. 27) of the Saviour is witnessed, *then* the Kingdom will be established. So long as “the city of the great King,” and so long as His land. His by inheritance (Prop. 116), as David’s Son, *is under Gentile dominion*, it is *simply impossible* for the Kingdom to exist; and *it is folly to argue*, with the light of the Davidic covenant and prophetic announcements relating to it, that the Messianic Kingdom has been set up. This Jewish tribulation, these times of the Gentiles, this gathering out of an elect, the non-fulfilment of “these things,”—these, and a multitude (in following Propositions), Propositions), of considerations, show that it is *thus postponed*.

>The proof on this point is abundant. Thus e.g. the Kingdom is associated with the period of “restitution” (Prop. 144), “regeneration” (Prop. 145), “revelation of Jesus Christ” (Props. 138, 139), “the Judgeship” of Jesus (Props. 132, 133), “the new heavens and new earth” (Props. 148, 151), the reign of the saints (Prop. 154), the overthrow of Antichrist (Prop. 160), the Pre-Millennial personal Advent (Prop. 120), etc., etc.

>“*The house is left desolate*” until He comes again, when its fallen, desolate condition will be removed. One of the most decided and expressive passages is that of Matt. 24:29, where, after delineating the Jewish tribulation running down through an allotted “times of the Gentiles” we come to the language “immediately *after* the tribulation” (not before, but *after* it) certain events such as the open Advent of the Son of Man and the gathering of the elect, will take place, which in many places (as e.g. Matt. 25, Dan. 7, 2 Thess. 5, etc.) are associated with the setting up of the Kingdom. Such a portraiture of the course of events is in harmony with *the general and uniform testimony* of the Prophets, who almost invariably contrast this Kingdom with a previously endured tribulation by the Jewish nation which has finally ended through special Divine interposition (as e.g. Zech. 14, etc.), and the nation enjoys the blessedness of covenants fully and gloriously realized. With this Prop, must be united such Props, as 58, 88, etc.
