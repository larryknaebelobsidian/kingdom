# Proposition 113. The connection of this Kingdom with Jewish restoration necessitates the realization of their predicted repentance and conversion.

### Props Mentioned
18 38-41 121 122 133 137 144 170 172 174

>The restored Theocratic Kingdom is a *holy* Kingdom. God Himself, in the Person of His Son, again condescends to act as earthly Ruler, but as He reveals Himself and His associated Rulers in a higher and more intimate personal relationship, and as the design is to make this a powerful and all-pervading Kingdom, those who stand nationally in a covenanted and elect relationship must become *morally qualified* for its establishment. Hence the predicted repentance and conversion of the nation.
>p. 75 Vol. 2 Prop 113
### Jewish conversion and restoration combined in Romans 11
>Obs. 1. We have passed over Rom. 11, which combines the conversion and restoration. So self-evident is this, that our leading opponents concede this to us. Thus e.g. Dr. Brown (*Com.*, Rom. 8, etc.) interprets the chapter as plainly teaching a *national* conversion and restoration of the Jews; he rejects its application to “individual Jews,” and insists upon a “*national recovery of Israel*.”
>p. 75 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 1
### Result from personal coming of Jesus
>Obs. 2. The conversion and the restoration both result from *a personal Coming* of Jesus. Paul informs us (Rom. 11:25, 26) that when the fulness of the Gentiles is come in, *then* the blindness befallen Israel shall also be removed, because (*as the Jews believed*), “*there shall come out of Zion the Deliverer*,” etc., owing, as our argument has shown, to the Covenant, “*for this is my Covenant unto them*,” etc.
>p. 76 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 2
### Positively covenanted to Jews
>Obs. 3. This repentance, over against Ernesti and others, is positively covenanted to them, Isa. 44:22, 23; Rom. 11:26, 27; Isa. 59:19, 20, 21; Jer. 31:2, 3, etc.
>p. 79 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 3
### Actual Israel nation to repent and be restored
>Obs. 4. The mention of this repentance and restoration is designed to meet the objection of some (e.g. Dr. Oswald, *The Kingdom*, and *The Saints’ Inheritance* by Hill) that only the spiritual Israel, dead and dying, are brought to the land and inherit it, and that *the nation* now dispersed, etc., is *never* to be restored.
>p. 81 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 4
### Lack of discrimination is source of error
>A fruitful source of error on the restoration arises from not discriminating between the saints and others, between the exalted brethren and coheir’s of Christ and the subjects over whom they reign with Christ, between the inheritors of the Kingdom and the Kingdom itself.
>p. 82 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 4
### Extraordinary repentance
>It is no *ordinary* repentance, and not merely that of individuals, but *extraordinary and national* in its extent, Micah 7:15-20, etc. It is *caused* by 
>1. the judgments of God, Mal. 3:2-4; Hos. 5:15; Isa. 30:18-19, and 
>2. the personal presence of the King, Micah 2:12-13; Ezek. 20:33-44; Zeph. 3:15. 
>3. It is done that God’s faithfulness may appear, Ezek. 36:22; Isa. 43:25; Isa. 44:22-26. 
>4. It is bestowed in the land given to their fathers into which they are brought, Ezek. 36:24-35; Jer. 33:7-16; Jer. 32:37-44; Jer. 31, etc. 
>5. The reign of the Messiah is intimately connected with it, as e.g. in Jer. 23:3-8; Ezek. 34:23-31, etc. 
>The absence of such national repentance for the last eighteen hundred years is no proof that it *never* will be accomplished. On the other hand, it is decisive that it *will yet come* to pass, if we but consider that this very absence of repentance—excepting in individual cases—this “veil” of unbelief covering them, is also predicted.
>p. 84 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 5 reformatted
### Order of repentance
>Obs. 6. The attention of the reader is called, briefly, to *the order* of repentance as foretold by the Divine Spirit.
>p. 85 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6

>Now, first of all, the fact must be kept in view that a part of the Jewish nation (those of Judah and Benjamin) is restored to the land and occupy Jerusalem *previous* to the open Parousia of Jesus with His saints.
>p. 85 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6

Zech. 14:2, Zech. 12:2,

>This *partial* restoration must be carefully distinguished *from the one* under the Messiah, for *this* is a restoration which means suffering and terrible persecution by Antichrist, while *the other* is full of blessing. This restoration will be, in all probability, *between* the two stages of the Sec. Advent, and, owing to the unbelief of the nation in Jesus as the Messiah, will result in the re-establishment of a temple, a splendid temple service, a return to the Mosaic ritual and former distinctive national usages. The *persistent* rejection of Jesus as the true Messiah will cause the fearful tribulation predicted to overwhelm them and plunge them in despair.
>p. 85 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6

>The Lord shall save “*Judah first*” (Zech. 12:7) and He (v. 10) “*will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born. In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem*” etc. (Some representatives of the ten tribes are also present, as in “house of Levi, family of Shimei,” or Sep., “Simeon,” but Judah is largely predominant and hence most prominently mentioned.)
>p. 85-86 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6

>... Israel (the ten tribes) is brought in at least forty years *after* the overthrow of Antichrist and *after* the restoration of Judah.
>p. 86 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6

>The work of conversion and restoration shall proceed, after the wicked one (2 Thess. 2:8) is slain, as seen e.g. in Isa. 11:4-16; Isa. 66:15-24; Zeph. 3:8-20, etc., until every one is gathered, and Gentiles shall assist in bringing them to the land.
>p. 87 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6

>Elijah is a forerunner of the Sec. Advent (the open Parousia) just as John was a forerunner of the First Advent (the public appearance of the Messiah).
>p. 87 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6

>We conclude with this declaration: Whatever agencies God may employ in this conversion, and whatever wonders of an astounding nature He may vouchsafe to manifest, *He immeasurably exalts Himself and forever enshrines Himself* in the love of a recovered people: for “*Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retaineth not His anger forever, because He delighteth in mercy. he will turn again, He will have compassion upon us; He will subdue our iniquities; and Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham, which Thou hath sworn unto our Fathers from the days of old. Amen*"
>p. 88 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6

>Hence we deprecate all movements, suggested by a pious but misguided zeal, *to colonize* Palestine with converted Jews.  It can *only result disastrously*, for if such would be left at the first stage of the Advent (which introduces a resurrection and translation of living ones) they place themselves, voluntarily, in the country which, according to prediction, is to suffer the special vengeance of Antichrist (Zech. 14; Dan. 12, etc.). Let unbelieving Jews colonize if they desire, and thus pave the way for a future fulfilment, but let the believing refrain, well knowing that when the restoration once takes place under the Messiah, they too, wherever they may be, shall be called to see its greatness and glory.  Those colonization movements are based on the mistaken idea that *previous* to the Sec. Advent a believing, converted portion of the nation shall be restored; while prophecy -- if we properly discriminate the order -- teaches *the exact opposite*.  The conversion, the fitness, and fruitfulness of the land, etc., are *all* the result of supernatural power under a present, personal Messiah.  It is, therefore, the wisest and best *to wait* for Him to do this work, and when He has inaugurated it, then also will the nations -- awed by the manifestatons of His power -- willingly -- as prophecy teaches us -- assist in restoring the nation.
>p. 88 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6 Note 1

>Although prophecy so distinctly announces *the means and manner* of conversion, yet men fettered by their Church-Kingdom theory must give a different version of the matter.
  ...
  God has pledged Himself and "assigned the honor of that ingathering *to the Gentile Church*". 
  ... 
  God has pledged Himself that this shall be brought about through Him whom He has ordained for the purpose.  We are not to neglect the Jews, but through missions, etc., we are to try to save them that believe; we are to gather out individual jews, just as individual Gentiles are gathered, while the nation at large remains untouched until the Sec. Advent.
  ... 
  The fact as represented in e.g. Rom. 11 (comp. Fausset's Thoughts on, *Com.*, Isa. 66:19) indicates that the Jews instead of being converted nationally under the  instrumentality of Gentile missions, will be, after their conversion and restoration, the grand instrumentality of the conversion the Gentiles -- the fulfulment of God's Word in them, in their exalted Theocratic relationship fully manifested, etc., materially aiding.
  p. 88-89 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6 Note 2

>The restoration of the entire Jewish nation will take at least forty years, for it is said, Mic. 7:15, "*According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I show unto him marvellous things.*" 
  p. 91 Vol. 2 Prop 113 Obs. 6 Note 6

>The reader may well ponder *the great change* of view, *the mighty revulsion* of feeling as *then* manifested in the Jewish nation! To acknowledge Jesus, the once despised and cursed, to be the Messiah will, indeed, demand the severest judgments, the special exhibitions of power, predicted.  Once Jesus was contemptuously called "The Hung," "The Fool," "The Blasphemer," etc., and of Him it was said, "May His memory be destroyed and His name be blotted out," but *then* He will be called "*The Blessed*," "*The Messiah*," "*The Redeemer*;" and of Him it will be said, "*This is our God*."  While bitterness and hatred are perpetuated among the more illiterate and bigoted of the nation (largely attributable to the past dealings of professed Christians), yet every intelligent reader must have noticed that in many, the more intelligent, a change for the better is transpiring.  While unwilling as yet to admit the Messianic claims of Jesus, many of their writers speak *respectfully* of Jesus as a great moral teacher, and seem to take a pride in His having been a Jew, and instrumental, through His teaching, in keeping the Jewish nation so prominently before the Gentile nations.  Indeed, some of the finest eulogies (Renan-like) of Jesus as a man and moral teacher, now come from Jewish sources.
