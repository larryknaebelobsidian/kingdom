# Proposition 113. The connection of this Kingdom with Jewish restoration necessitates the realization of their predicted repentance and conversion.

>The restored Theocratic Kingdom is a holy Kingdom. God Himself, in the Person of His Son, again condescends to act as earthly Ruler, but as He reveals Himself and His associated Rulers in a higher and more intimate personal relationship, and as the design is to make this a powerful and all-pervading Kingdom, those who stand nationally in a covenanted and elect relationship must become morally qualified for its establishment. Hence the predicted repentance and conversion of the nation.

>Obs. 1. We have passed over Rom. 11, which combines the conversion and restoration. So self-evident is this, that our leading opponents concede this to us. Thus e.g. Dr. Brown (Com., Rom. 8, etc.) interprets the chapter as plainly teaching a national conversion and restoration of the Jews; he rejects its application to “individual Jews,” and insists upon a “national recovery of Israel.”

>Obs. 2. The conversion and the restoration both result from a personal Coming of Jesus. Paul informs us (Rom. 11:25, 26) that when the fulness of the Gentiles is come in, then the blindness befallen Israel shall also be removed, because (as the Jews believed), “there shall come out of Zion the Deliverer,” etc., owing, as our argument has shown, to the Covenant, “for this is my Covenant unto them,” etc.

>Obs. 3. This repentance, over against Ernesti and others, is positively covenanted to them, Isa. 44:22, 23; Rom. 11:26, 27; Isa. 59:19, 20, 21; Jer. 31:2, 3, etc.

>Obs. 4. The mention of this repentance and restoration is designed to meet the objection of some (e.g. Dr. Oswald, The Kingdom, and The Saints’ Inheritance by Hill) that only the spiritual Israel, dead and dying, are brought to the land and inherit it, and that the nation now dispersed, etc., is never to be restored.

>A fruitful source of error on the restoration arises from not discriminating between the saints and others, between the exalted brethren and coheir’s of Christ and the subjects over whom they reign with Christ, between the inheritors of the Kingdom and the Kingdom itself.
>Obs. 4

>It is no ordinary repentance, and not merely that of individuals, but extraordinary and national in its extent, Micah 7:15-20, etc. It is caused by 
>1. the judgments of God, Mai. 3:2—4; Hos. 5:15; Isa. 30:18-19, and 
>2. the personal presence of the King, Micah 2:12-13; Ezek. 20:33-44; Zeph. 3:15. 
>3. It is done that God’s faithfulness may appear, Ezek. 36:22; Isa. .43:25; Isa. 44:22-26. 
>4. It is bestowed in the land given to their fathers into which they are brought, Ezek. 36:24-35; Jer. 33:7-16; Jer. 32:37-44; Jer. 31, etc. 
>5. The reign of the Messiah is intimately connected with it, as e.g. in Jer. 23:3-8; Ezek. 34:23-31, etc. 
>The absence of such national repentance for the last eighteen hundred years is no proof that it never will be accomplished. On the other hand, it is decisive that it will yet come to pass, if we but consider that this very absence of repentance—excepting in individual cases—this “veil” of unbelief covering them, is also predicted.
>Obs. 5 reformatted

>Obs. 6. The attention of the reader is called, briefly, to the order of repentance as foretold by the Divine Spirit.

>Now, first of all, the fact must be kept in view that a part of the Jewish nation (those of Judah and Benjamin) is restored to the land and occupy Jerusalem previous to the open Parousia of Jesus with His saints.
>Obs. 6

Zech. 14:2, Zech. 12:2,

>This partial restoration must be carefully distinguished from the one under the Messiah, for this is a restoration which means suffering and terrible persecution by Antichrist, while the other is full of blessing. This restoration will be, in all probability, between the two stages of the Sec. Advent, and, owing to the unbelief of the nation in Jesus as the Messiah, will result in the re-establishment of a temple, a splendid temple service, a return to the Mosaic ritual and former distinctive national usages.
>Obs. 6

>The Lord shall save “Judah first” (Zech. 12:7) and He (v. 10) “will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon Me whom they nave pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born. In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem” etc. (Some representatives of the ten tribes are also present, as in “house of Levi, family of Shimei,” or Sep., “Simeon,” but Judah is largely predominant and hence most prominently mentioned.)
>Obs. 6

>Israel (the ten tribes) is brought in at least forty years after the overthrow of Antichrist and after the restoration of Judah.
>Obs. 6

>The work of conversion and restoration shall proceed, after the wicked one (2 Thess. 2:8) is slain, as seen e.g. in Isa. 11:4-16; Isa. 66:15-24; Zeph. 3:8-20, etc., until every one is gathered, and Gentiles shall assist in bringing them to the land.
>Obs. 6

>Elijah is a forerunner of the Sec. Advent (the open Parousia) just as John was a forerunner of the First Advent (the public appearance of the Messiah).
>Obs. 6
