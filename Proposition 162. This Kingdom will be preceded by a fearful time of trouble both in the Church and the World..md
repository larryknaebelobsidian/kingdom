>The rise and progress of the Antichrist, the acts performed by him, the persecution experienced under him, and the outpouring of God’s judgments, all embrace *a series of trial and trouble unexampled* in the history of the world.
>p. 731 Vol. 2 Prop. 162
### Gospel will not be accepted by the masses
>... the Bible does not tell us that down to the Sec. Advent the Gospel will be accepted by the masses, but exactly the reverse (Prop. 175, etc.).
>p. 732 Vol. 2 Prop. 162 Obs. 1
### Immediately preceeding the open manifestation of Christ
>That fearful times are *immediately to precede* the open manifestations of Jesus Christ was so distinctly taught in the Old Test, by various prophets and especially by Daniel, that the Jews universally held to *a great time of trouble preceding the times of the Messiah*.
>p. 734 Vol. 2 Prop. 162 Obs. 2

>... the Rabbins called “*the birth pangs of the Messiah*”.
>p. 734 Vol. 2 Prop. 162 Obs. 2

>“This all the Rabbins refer to the Coming of the Messiah. If ye see a generation that endures *much tribulation*, then (say they) expect Him according to what is written, “*when the enemy shall come in as a flood*,” etc.
>p. 734-725 Vol. 2 Prop. 162 Obs. 2

>... from the *Latter Confession of Helvetia* (1566), XI Art., “Out of heaven the same Christ will return unto Judgment, even then, *when wickedness shall chiefly reign in the world, and when Antichrist, having corrupted true religion, shall fill all things with superstition and impiety, and shall most cruelly destroy the Church with fire and bloodshed.*”
>p. 735 Vol. 2 Prop. 162 Obs. 2
### All believers to endure a severe persecution under antichrist
>All believers in Jesus Christ then existing shall endure a sharp and excessively severe persecution under Antichrist.
>p. 738 Vol. 2 Prop. 162 Obs. 5

>Love for these, love for the Church, love for our fellow-men, love for the truth .and the Redeemer, should influence us neither *to neglect* these things nor *to keep silence* respecting them.
>p. 739 Vol. 2 Prop. 162 Obs. 5

>... *yet there remains the broad and distinctive outlines of a coming dreadful, persecuting power* under which believers shall fall as the wheat before the reaper.
>p. 739 Vol. 2 Prop. 162 Obs. 5

>... just before the open revelation of Jesus Christ, *the Antichrist*, whoever he may be, *shall terribly persecute the people of God*.
>p. 739 Vol. 2 Prop. 162 Obs. 5

>The double assurance is thus given that this Antichrist has his time limited, and that the persecution is to be a short one.
>p. 739 Vol. 2 Prop. 162 Obs. 5

>Lincoln too much overlooks 
>(1) the continued election of the true believers based on an engrafting into the nation (as shown by us e. g. Props. 59-65) and 
>(2) that only after a special translation of favored ones does the Church arise to a full consciousness of its chronological and eschatological position, resulting in many coming up out of the tribulation.
