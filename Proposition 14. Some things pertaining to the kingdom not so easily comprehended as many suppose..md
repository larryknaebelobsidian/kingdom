### Obs. 3

> There is no systematic statement of the doctrine of the Kingdom in the Bible.   It is given in brief covenants, in separate prophecies, in detached portions, in fragments, in hints, in promises, in concise outlines, and to bring all these together in their regular order much labor is requisite.
> p. 152 Vol. 1 Prop. 14 Obs. 3

> Unless there is a deep conviction that the Bible is a Divine Record, and that, in consequence, everything that is contains should be duly weighed and placed in its connection with the Divine Purpose, it is impossible to harmonize the Word: some discordant elements will inevitably appear to prevent unity.
