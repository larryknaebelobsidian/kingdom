# Proposition 14. Some things pertaining to the kingdom not so easily comprehended as many suppose.
### Mystery
>Obs. 1. Taking the word “mystery” to denote, as theologians state, something revealed that was before unknown, Revelation itself must be carefully scanned and compared to appreciate these. At the same time, whilst a fact is disclosed, or an ordering is divulged, yet the reason *why* it will, or *the manner* in which it may, be accomplished is either not explained or merely hinted at, thus leaving large room for attentive study and reflection. Besides this, many things—the great burden—relating to the Kingdom are still in the shape of unfulfilled prophecy and promise, requiring *discrimination* to distinguish what belongs to different dispensations, to the two Advents, to the past, present, and future, so that we may form a correct estimate of the preparatory stages and of the Kingdom itself. The Apocalypse, with its varied and discordant interpretations, alone proves our proposition.
>p. 151 Vol. 1 Prop. 14 Obs. 1

### The gospel of the kingdom is not understood by many
>Obs. 2. Some persons confidently tell us that “*the Gospel of the Kingdom*” is readily understood by all men, forgetting how variously it is interpreted and preached.
>p. 151 Vol. 1 Prop. 14 Obs. 2

### Must discriminate between the mean of obtaining the kingdom and the kingdom itself
>We must discriminate *between the means* employed by which the Kingdom can be obtained—which is also Gospel or glad tidings—and *the Kingdom itself*—which proclaimed is the Gospel in its fullest sense.
>p. 152 Vol. 1 Prop. 14 Obs. 2

### No systematic statement of the doctrine of the kingdom in the Bible
> There is no systematic statement of the doctrine of the Kingdom in the Bible.   It is given in brief covenants, in separate prophecies, in detached portions, in fragments, in hints, in promises, in concise outlines, and to bring all these together in their regular order much labor is requisite.
> p. 152 Vol. 1 Prop. 14 Obs. 3

### Consequence of not having deep conviction that the Bible is a Divine Record
> Unless there is a deep conviction that the Bible is a Divine Record, and that, in consequence, everything that is contains should be duly weighed and placed in its connection with the Divine Purpose, it is impossible to harmonize the Word: some discordant elements will inevitably appear to prevent unity.
> p. 152 Vol. 1 Prop. 14 Obs. 3

### Careful collation required
>unless there is *a careful collation* of all passages that legitimately refer to the Kingdom, error may, more or less, be advanced. If, as claimed, the Scriptures are the Word of God, then every word -- conceding that the truth is given through the language and style most familiar to the writer -- is of importance. 
>p. 152 Vol. 1 Prop. 14 Obs. 3 note

### Avoiding extremes
>Obs. 4. Avoiding, on the one hand, the opinion of the Romish Church that the Scriptures are so unintelligible, so obscure that they need the interpretation of the Church, of Councils, of the Fathers, or of the Pope; and, on the other hand, the view of some Protestant divines, and others, that all things are clear and intelligible to him who is in the Spirit—it is best to preserve the due medium, that whilst many things are plainly stated, yet others, for the reasons given, can only be ascertained by laborious research, or, as some old writers have quaintly observed, by “digging for hid treasures.” The Kingdom, forming the subject-matter of a large portion of the Bible, cannot be correctly apprehended in its totality without the student passing over all that the different sacred writers have to say concerning it.
>p. 152 Vol. 1 Prop. 14 Obs. 4

### The Gospel of the Kingdom includes the mystery of God
>Obs. 5. “The Gospel *of the Kingdom*,” as intimated, includes “the mystery of God,” i.e. the final, closing act as presented Rev. 10:7, embracing the ultimate realization of the previously ordained provisionary institutions.
>p. 152-153 Vol. 1 Prop. 14 Obs. 4

### Gospel includes the grand consummation
>the Gospel undoubtedly comprehends the grand consummation, the perfected Redemption realized only in the Kingdom.
>p. 153 Vol. 1 Prop. 14 Obs. 5
