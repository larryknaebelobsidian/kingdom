>This is a decided landmark in prophecy, and nearly every prophet dilates, more or less, on this feature, viz., that Antichrist is destroyed at the personal presence of the Christ. We, for the present, only direct attention to three: Paul in 2 Thess. 2, Daniel in ch. 7, and John in Rev. 19. The early Church and a long line of witnesses held that these synchronize;

### Key passages
#### 2 Thess. 2:1-12
Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,2 that you not be quickly shaken in your mind or be alarmed whether by a spirit or a word or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. 3 Let no one in any way deceive you, for _it has not come_ unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, 4 who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the sanctuary of God, exhibiting himself as being God.5 Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things? 6 And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed. 7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains _will do so_ until he is taken out of the way. 8 And then that lawless one will be revealed—whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming— 9 whose coming is in accord with the working of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders, 10 and with all the deception of unrighteousness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved. 11 And for this reason God sends upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, 12 in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in unrighteousness.
#### Daniel 7:1-28
In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions in his head _as he lay_ on his bed; then he wrote the dream down _and_ said the _following_ summary of the matter. 2 Daniel answered and said, “I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. 3 And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another. 4 The first _was_ like a lion and had _the_ wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; and a heart of a man was given to it. 5 And behold, another beast, a second one in the likeness of a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs _were_ in its mouth between its teeth; and thus they said to it, ‘Arise, devour much meat!’ 6 After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it. 7 After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, fearsome and terrifying and extraordinarily strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. 8 While I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great _boasts_. 15 “As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me, and the visions of my head kept alarming me.16 I came near to one of those who were standing by and began seeking out _from_ him the exact meaning of all this. So he said _it_ to me and made known to me the interpretation of these things: 17 ‘These great beasts, which are four _in number_, are four kings _who_ will arise from the earth. 18 But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, for all ages to come.’ 19 “Then I desired to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, extraordinarily fearsome, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, _and which_ devoured, crushed, and trampled down the remainder with its feet, 20 and _the meaning_ of the ten horns that _were_ on its head and the other _horn_ which came up and before which three _of them_ fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth speaking great _boasts_ and which was larger in appearance than its associates. 21 I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the saints and overcoming them 22 until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the season arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom. 23 “Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, which will be different from all the _other_ kingdoms and will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it. 24 As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will make low three kings. 25 He will speak words against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make changes in seasons and in law; and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time. 26 But the court will sit _for judgment_, and his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever. 27 Then the reign, the dominion, and the greatness of _all_ the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom _will be_ an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.’ 28 “At this point the matter _of this revelation_ ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me, and the splendor of my _face_ changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.” 9 “I kept looking Until thrones were set up, And the Ancient of Days was seated; His clothing _was_ like white snow And the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne _was_ ablaze with fire, Its wheels _were_ a burning fire. 10 A river of fire was flowing And coming out from before Him; Thousands upon thousands were attending Him, And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him; The court sat, And the books were opened. 11 Then I kept looking because of the sound of the great _boastful_ words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was killed, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire.12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for an appointed season of time. 13 “I kept looking in the night visions, And behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, And He came up to the Ancient of Days And came near before Him. 14 And to Him was given dominion, Glory, and a kingdom, That all the peoples, nations, and _men of every_ tongue Might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion Which will not be taken away; And His kingdom is one Which will not be destroyed.
#### Revelation 19
After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven, saying,“Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God; 2 because His judgments are true and righteous; for He has judged the great harlot who was corrupting the earth with her sexual immorality, and He has avenged the blood of His slaves _shed_ by her hand.” 3 And a second time they said, “Hallelujah! Her smoke rises up forever and ever.” 4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!” 5 And a voice came from the throne, saying,“Give praise to our God, all you His slaves, you who fear Him, the small and the great.” 6 Then I heard _something_ like the voice of a great crowd and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying,“Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns. 7 Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready.” 8 And it was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright _and_ clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. 9 Then he said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.’” And he said to me, “These are true words of God.” 10 Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow slave with you and your brothers who have the witness of Jesus. Worship God! For the witness of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” 11 Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it _is_ called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war. 12 His eyes _are_ a flame of fire, and on His head _are_ many diadems; having a name written _on Him_ which no one knows except Himself, 13 and being clothed with a garment dipped in blood, His name is also called The Word of God. 14 And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white _and_ clean, were following Him on white horses. 15 And from His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the wrath of the rage of God, the Almighty. 16 And He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.” 17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, “Come, assemble for the great supper of God, 18 so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of strong men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great.” 19 Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army. 20 And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who did the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone. 21 And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sits on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
### Importance of anti-christ's destruction at the coming of Christ
>Obs. 1. It is admitted by all our recent prophetical writers that Antichrist shall exist previous to the Millennial age—this is so plain in the confederation of nations existing then, that it needs no additional proof— now if we can show that he is destroyed by the personal Coming of Jesus, we have a personal Pre-Mill. Coming. Christ. 

>The predictions relating to the Millennium clearly portray the removal of the man of sin and of his adherents before that age; and they reveal the impossibility of reconciling their presence with the realization of that age of blessedness.
>Obs. 1
### "Destroyed by the brightness of His coming"
>Obs. 2. The passage to which special attention is called reads: “And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His Coming,” 2 Thess. 2:8. Owing to its importance and the efforts made to give it an interpretation adapted to the modern Whitbyan theory, it will be best to examine it in detail.
 

>A. Those to whom Paul wrote were looking for the personal Advent of Christ.
>...
>>The period when the Messiah is to be personally manifested as the Judge, the King, etc., is often called “His day" etc., and was so understood both by the Jews and early Christians.
>...
>Obs. 2


>B. The Apostle then designs to correct the mistake respecting the presence or nearness of that personal Coming in which they believed, and the manner in which he does this confirms the allusion to the personal Coming.
>...
>>it shall not come until at least a certain event, viz., the appearing and power of the man of sin, was first witnessed;
>...
>>he introduces the predicted fact that before that visible Advent or day of Christ, the wicked one must arise and be exalted in power. It legitimately follows from the tenor of the proof given, that this personal Advent is not “at hand” or “present;” that it will, after an intervening event has been fulfilled, then come to pass.
>...
>Obs. 2

>C. The Apostle’s proof of the day of Christ and hence also the personal Advent not being “at hand” or “present,” thus fully accords with the analogy of Scripture. Many are the predictions and pointed allusions that Christ's visible personal Advent only takes place at a time when Antichrist or a mighty confederation of wickedness is developed, and that He will at such a Coming take vengeance and utterly destroy the wicked arrayed against Him. All prophecy agrees in uniting the destruction of the Antichristian power with a personal Advent.
>...
>>acts of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly are united with, in passages admitted to relate to the Sec. Advent
>...
>Obs. 2

>D. The Apostle, in introducing the Coming of the Lord Jesus to destroy this Antichrist, was undoubtedly aware of the views of the Jews on this subject. The Jews, impelled by the prophecies, looked for a personal Coming of the Messiah to destroy the wicked one.
>Obs. 2

>E. The import of the two words rendered “brightness of His Coming.” Epiphaneia, ἐπιφανεία, called here “brightness,” and Parousia, παρουσία, translated “Coming.”
>...
>>(a) The word Epiphaneia occurs six times, 1 Tim. 6:14; 2 Tim. 1:10; 2 Tim. 4:1 and 8; Tit. 2:13, and in this place.
>...
>>(b) The word Parousia is used in the New Test, twenty-four times, Matt. 24:3, 27, 37, 39; 1 Cor. 15:23, and 16:17; 2 Cor. 7:6, 7, and 10:10; Phil. 1:26, and 2:3; 1 Thess. 2:19, and 3:13, and 4:15, and 5:23; 2 Thess. 2:1, 8, 9; James 5:7, 8; 2 Pet. 1:16, and 3:4, 12, and 1 John 2:18.
>Obs. 2

>F. The opinions of commentators—of the class who have no sympathy with our views, but yet are candid enough to concede this vital point, and of others who express themselves independently of any theory or bias, etc.
>Obs. 2

>G. It is important to notice the opinions of the early Apostolic Fathers, who being acquainted with the language as a living spoken one, and who receiving their interpretation of a passage which would excite special attention from the hands of the apostles or their immediate disciples, may thus afford strong corroborative evidence.
>Obs. 2

>H. Even after the allegorizing interpretation, introduced by the Alexandrian school, by which such passages as these are so readily transformed into various meanings, the Divines still insisted that this Scripture taught a personal coming to destroy Antichrist.
>Obs. 2

>I. The Popish writers, however they may apply it, ascribe it to a personal Advent.
>Obs. 2

>J. The opinions of the Reformers, although making the apostasy and the man of sin to be one and the same, are distinctly in our favor.
>Obs. 2

>K. The opinions of eminent Divines who endorsed the Whitbyan theory.
>Obs. 2
### Early Fathers agreed
>Obs. 4. It is scarcely necessary to add anything additional to Dan. 7:13 to indicate a personal Advent. All the early Fathers, as well as those who followed them, even such a writer as Jerome (Bickersteth’s Guide, p. 112, quotes from, and also shows how Jerome made the little horn of Daniel 7 synchronize with the man of sin 2 Thess. 2) made it refer to the personal Sec. Advent.
