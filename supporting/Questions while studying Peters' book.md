## Nations
Who comprise the "nations" in the 1000 years?
	Unsaved nations will survive the return of Christ and the conflagration per Peters.
	These unsaved nations will continue to bear children.
	These unsaved nations will be the subjects of the Kingdom that are ruled by a rod of iron.

Who comprise the "nations" in the eternal state?
	All saved per Peters
	Bearing children?
	No sin

What are differences between the 'nations' and the 'saints' in the eternal state?

## Translation / Resurrection

What is the relationship between resurrection and Peters' translation?

Are there more than two resurrections per Peters? If so, how many?

Is Peters' "translation" the same as the rapture?
	144,000 in Rev. 14 are purchased from thee earth (Peter's believes translated?)
	Earth is reaped (Rev. 14:16) Is this both a translation and resurrection?

Is there more than one rapture per Peters ("translation" of living saints - this is the word used by Peters)? If so, how many?

Who gets translated and when? (this seems to be related to rewards ([Prop. 135](Proposition%20135.%20The%20doctrine%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20in%20full%20accord%20with%20the%20Scriptural%20doctrine%20of%20the%20judgment%20of%20believers,..md)) for the faithful) 
## Conflagration
Prop. 149 - Peters says the conflagration comes BEFORE the millennium.  How does this agree with Revelation 21 (AFTER) Revelation 20? Peters' conflagration is a renewing of the heavens and earth, not a total vaporization of them.  Precisely how some humans/animals survive is not known.

New heaven and new earth (Rev. 21) happens at beginning of millennium per Peters.

## 144,000
Peters appears to believe that the sealing of the 144,000 (Rev 7) means that they are removed (translated)

Peters also appears to believe that the 144,000 seen with the Lamb on Mt. Zion, mentioned in Rev. 14, is a different group than the 144,000 mentioned in Rev. 7.
