[Abrahamic Covenant](Abrahamic%20Covenant.md)

After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision, saying,
“Do not fear, Abram,
I am a shield to you;
Your reward shall be very great.”

2 And Abram said, “O Lord Yahweh, what will You give me, as I go on being childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” 3 And Abram said, “Since You have given no [seed](seed) to me, behold, one born in my house is my heir.” 4 Then behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, “This one will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.” 5 And He brought him outside and said, “Now look toward the heavens, and number the [stars](stars), if you are able to number them.” And He said to him, “So shall your [seed](seed) be.” 6 Then he [believed](believed) in Yahweh; and [He counted it to him as righteousness](He%20counted%20it%20to%20him%20as%20righteousness).
