[[Davidic Covenant]]

8 So now, thus you shall say to My servant David, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “I Myself took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel. 9 And I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a [[great name]], like the name of the great men who are on the earth. 10 And I will appoint a [[place]] for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own [[place]] and not be disturbed again; and the [[unrighteous will not afflict them]] any more as formerly, 11 even from the day that I commanded judges _to be_ over My people Israel; and I will give you [[rest from all your enemies]]. Yahweh also declares to you that Yahweh will make a [[house]] for you. 12 When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, [[I will raise up]] _one of_ your [[seed]] after you, who will come forth from your own body, and I will establish [[his kingdom]]. 13 He shall build a [[house]] for My name, and I will establish the throne of [[his kingdom]] [[forever]]. 14 I will be a [[father]] to him and he will be a [[son]] to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will reprove him with the rod of men and the strikes from the sons of men, 15 but My lovingkindness shall not be removed from him, as I removed _it_ from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 16 And your house and your [[Kingdom]] shall endure before Me [[forever]]; your [[throne]] shall be established [[forever]].”’”
