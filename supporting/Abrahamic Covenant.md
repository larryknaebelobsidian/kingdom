#### 15:1-21 -
  The LORD came to Abram in a vision
 
After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision, saying,
“Do not fear, Abram,
I am a shield to you;
Your reward shall be very great.”
2 And Abram said, “O Lord Yahweh, what will You give me, as I go on being childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” 3 And Abram said, “Since You have given no seed to me, behold, one born in my house is my heir.” 4 Then behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, “This one will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.” 5 And He brought him outside and said, “Now look toward the heavens, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.” And He said to him, “So shall your seed be.” 6 Then he believed in Yahweh; and He counted it to him as righteousness. 7 And He said to him, “I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it.” 8 And he said, “O Lord Yahweh, how may I know that I will possess it?” 9 So He said to him, “Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” 10 Then he brought all these to Him and split them into parts down the middle and laid each part opposite the other; but he did not split apart the birds. 11 Then the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.12 Now it happened that when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror _and_ great darkness fell upon him. 13 Then _God_ said to Abram, “Know for certain that your seed will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. 14 But I will also judge the nation to whom they are enslaved, and afterward they will come out with many possessions. 15 As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age. 16 Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.”17 Now it happened that the sun had set, and it was very dark, and behold, _there appeared_ a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces. 18 On that day Yahweh cut a covenant with Abram, saying,
“To your seed I have given this land,
From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates:
19 the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite 20 and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim 21 and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite.”

#### 17:1-22 - Abraham was 99 years old
  The LORD appeared to Abraham

Now it happened that when Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him,
“I am God Almighty;
Walk before Me and be blameless,
2 so that I may confirm My covenant between Me and you,
And that I may multiply you exceedingly.”
3 Then Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying, 
4 “As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you,
And you will be the father of a multitude of nations.
5 And no longer shall your name be called Abram,
But your name shall be Abraham;
For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
6 And I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will go forth from you. 7 And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your seed after you. 8 And I will give to you and to your seed after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”9 God said further to Abraham, “Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations. 10 This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your seed after you: every male among you shall be circumcised. 11 And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you. 12 And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, one who is born in the house or one who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your seed. 13 A _servant_ who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall surely be circumcised; thus shall My covenant be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 14 But an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”15 Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah _shall be_ her name. 16 And I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be _a mother of_ nations; kings of peoples will come from her.” 17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart, “Will _a son_ be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear _a son_?” 18 And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before You!” 19 But God said, “No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. 21 But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year.” 22 So He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

#### 22:15-18 - Abraham obeys God by offering his son Isaac
  The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven
  - because you have not withheld your son, your only son
  - I will greatly bless you
  - I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore
  - your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies
  - In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed 
  - because you have obeyed My voice

### Isaac 
#### (@Gerar) 26:2-5; 
The LORD appeared to Isaac and said to him:
  - Don't go to Egypt (due to the famine)
  - Stay in the land of which I shall tell you
  - To you and your descendents I will give all these lands
  - I will establish the oath which I swore to your father Abraham
  - I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven
  - I will give your descendants all these lands
  - By your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed
  - Because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, commandments, statutes and laws
  
#### (@Beersheba) 26:23-24 
  The LORD appeared to Isaac at night
  - Do not fear, I am with you
  - I will bless you

### Jacob

  - I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham, and the God of Isaac
  - I will give the land on which you lie to you and to your descendants
  - Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth
  - You will spread out to the west, east, north, south
  - In you and your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed
  - I am with you
  - I will keep you wherever you go
  - I will bring you back to this land
  - I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you
  
#### 35:9-13 (God appeared and blessed Jacob)
  God said
  - Your name shall no longer be called Jacob but Israel
  - Be fruitful and multiply
  - A nation and a company of nations shall come from you and kings shall come from you
  - I will give you the land I gave to Abraham and Isaac
  - I will give to your descendants after you the land I gave to Abraham and Isaac
