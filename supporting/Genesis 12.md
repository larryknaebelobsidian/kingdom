[[Abrahamic Covenant]]

And Yahweh said to Abram,
“Go forth from your land,
And from your kin
And from your father’s house,
To the land which I will show you;
2 And I will make you a great [[nation]],
And I will [[bless]] you,
And make your [[name]] great;
And so [[You shall be a blessing]];
3 And I will [[bless]] those who bless you,
And the one who curses you I will [[curse]].
And in you [[all the families of the earth will be blessed]].”

Go to the [[land]] which I will show you
	which I will show you
I will make you a great [[nation]]
I will [[bless]] you
I will make your [[name]] great
[[You shall be a blessing]]
I will [[bless]] those who bless you
I will [[curse]] the one who curses you
In you [[all the families of the earth will be blessed]]
