[[Abrahamic Covenant]]

Now it happened that when Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him,
“I am God Almighty;
Walk before Me and be blameless,
2 so that I may confirm My covenant between Me and you, And that I may multiply you exceedingly.”
3 Then Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying, 4 “As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you will be the [[Father of a multitude of nations]].
5 And no longer shall your name be called [[Abram]],
But your name shall be [[Abraham]];
For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
6 And I will make you exceedingly [[fruitful]], and I will make [[nations of you]], and [[kings will go forth from you]]. 7 And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your [[seed]] after you throughout their generations for an [[Everlasting Covenant]], to be God to you and to your [[seed]] after you. 8 And I will give to you and to your [[seed]] after you, the [[land]] of your sojournings, all the [[land]] of Canaan, for an [[everlasting possession]]; and I will be their God.”9 God said further to Abraham, “Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your [[seed]] after you throughout their generations. 10 This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your [[seed]] after you: every male among you shall be [[circumcised]]. 11 And you shall be [[circumcised]] in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the [[sign of the covenant]] between Me and you. 12 And every male among you who is eight days old shall be [[circumcised]] throughout your generations, one who is born in the house or one who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your [[seed]]. 13 A _servant_ who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall surely be [[circumcised]]; thus shall My covenant be in your flesh for an [[Everlasting Covenant]]. 14 But an uncircumcised male who is not [[circumcised]] in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”

### SARAH WILL BEAR ISAAC

15 Then God said to Abraham, “As for [[Sarai]] your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but [[Sarah]] _shall be_ her name. 16 And I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be [[_a mother of_ nations]]; [[kings of peoples]] will come from her.” 17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart, “Will _a son_ be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear _a son_?” 18 And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before You!” 19 But God said, “No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall call his name [[Isaac]]; and I will establish My covenant with him for an [[Everlasting Covenant]] for his seed after him. 20 As for [[Ishmael]], I have heard you; behold, I will bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the [[father of twelve princes]], and I will make him a [[great nation]]. 21 But My covenant I will establish with [[Isaac]], whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year.” 22 So He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
