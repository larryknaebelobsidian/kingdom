And if you are willing to accept it, John himself is **Elijah** who was to come.

[Matthew 16:14](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+16&h=40-016-014)

[Matthew 17:12](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+17&h=40-017-012)

but I say to you that **Elijah** already came, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”

[Matthew 27:47](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+27&h=40-027-047)

And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, began saying, “This man is calling for **Elijah**.”

[Matthew 27:49](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+27&h=40-027-049)

[Mark 6:15](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+6&h=41-006-015)

[Mark 9:13](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Mark+9&h=41-009-013)

[Luke 4:25](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+4&h=42-004-025)

But I say to you in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of **Elijah**, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land,

[Luke 4:26](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+4&h=42-004-026)

and yet **Elijah** was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.

[Luke 9:8](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+9&h=42-009-008)

[Luke 9:19](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+9&h=42-009-019)

[Romans 11:2](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Romans+11&h=45-011-002)

God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about **Elijah**, how he appeals to God against Israel?

[James 5:17](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=James+5&h=59-005-017)

**Elijah** was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
