1.
In the last days
	mountain of the Lord's temple
		established as highest of the mountains
		exalted above the hills
		peoples will stream to it
2.
		many nations will come and say
			come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord
			He will teach us his ways
				so that we will walk in his paths
		the law will go out from Zion
			the word of the LORD from Jerusalem
3.
	He will
		judge 
			many peoples
		settle disputes
			for strong nations far and wide
		beat their
			swords
				into plowshares
			spears
				into pruning hooks
4.
	Everyone will
		sit
			under 
				their own vine
				their own fig tree
5.
	All the nations may walk
		in the name of their gods

	We will walk
		in the name of the LORD
			our God for ever and ever

6.
	In that day
		I will gather
			the lame
		I will assemble
			the exiles
			those I have brought to grief
7.
		I will make 
			the lame
				my remnant
			those driven away
				a strong nation
		the LORD will rule over them
			in Mount Zion (where)
			from that day and forever (how long)
8.
		watchtower of the flock
		stronghold of Daughter Zion
		former dominion will be restored
		kingship will come to Daughter Jerusalem
			
9.
		No king
			cry aloud
		ruler perished
			pain like labor pain

10.
			writhe
				Daughter Zion
			now you must leave
				to camp in the open field
				to go Babylon
					there the lord will redeem you

11.
			now many nations gathered against you

12.
			they do not know 
				the thoughts of the LORD
			they do not understand 
				his plan
					he has gathered them
						like sheaves to the threshing floor

13.
			Rise and thresh Daughter Zion
			You will
				break to pieces many nations
				devote 
					their ill gotten gains to the LORD
					their wealth to the LORD of all the earth

## 5.
2.
	ruler over Israel
		out of Bethlehem Ephrathah
			small among clans of Judah
		origins from 
			old 
			ancient times
3.
	Israel
		will be abandoned
			until she who is in labor bears a son
			the rest of his brothers return to join the Israelites

4.
	He will 
		stand and 
		shepherd his flock
		in the strength of the LORD
		in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God
	They will
		live securely
			for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth

5.
	He will
		be our peace
			when Assyrians 
				invade our land
				march through our fortresses
	We will
		raise against them
			seven shepherds
			eight commanders
6.
			who will rule
				land of Assyria with sword
				land of Nimrod with drawn sword
	He will
		deliver us from the Assyrians
			when they 
				invade our land
				march across our borders

7.
	The remnant of Jacob
		will be in the midst of many peoples
			like 
				dew from the LORD
				showers on the grass
				which do not wait for anyone or depend on man
		will be 
			among the nations
			in the midst of many peoples
				like
					lion
					young lion

9.
		enemies
			your hand lifted up in triumph over
		foes
			all destroyed

10.
	In that day
		I will destroy
			your horses
			your chariots
11.
			the cities of your land
			all your strongholds
12.
		   your witchcraft (no longer cast spells)
13.
			your idols
			sacred stones
		you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands
14.
		I will uproot from among you  your Asherah poles
			when I demolish your cities
15.
		I will take vengeance (in anger and wrath)
			on the nations that have not obeyed me
