[Davidic Covenant](Davidic%20Covenant.md)

7 So now, thus shall you say to My servant David, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “I Myself took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel. 8 And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a [name](name) like the name of the great men who are on the earth. 9 And I will appoint a [place](place) for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own [place](place) and [not be disturbed](not%20be%20disturbed) again; and the [unrighteous will not waste them anymore](unrighteous%20will%20not%20waste%20them%20anymore) as formerly, 10 even from the day that I commanded judges _to be_ over My people Israel. And I will [subdue all your enemies](subdue%20all%20your%20enemies).And I tell you that Yahweh will build a house for you. 11 And it will be that when your days are fulfilled to go _to be_ with your fathers, [I will raise up](I%20will%20raise%20up) _one of_ your [seed](seed) after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his [Kingdom](Kingdom.md). 12 He shall build for Me a [house](house), and I will establish his [throne](throne) [forever](forever). 13 I will be a [father](father) to him and he will be a [son](son) to Me; and I will not remove My lovingkindness from him, as I removed _it_ from him who was before you. 14 But I will cause him to stand in My [house](house) and in My [Kingdom](Kingdom.md) [forever](forever), and his [throne](throne) shall be established [forever](forever).”’” 15 According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
