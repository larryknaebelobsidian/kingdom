>It is admitted by all authorities that this phraseology was current among the Jews, and was adopted by the first preachers of the Kingdom.

>Obs. 1. The Prop, needs no proof, for the fact is self-evident. First is to be found the well-known expectations of the Jews based on a literal interpretation of the prophecies; next, these are summed up in the expressive phrases “Kingdom of heaven,” etc., taken, as numerous writers inform us, from Dan. 7:13, 14; finally, John, Jesus, and others take the very phraseology adopted by the Jews to designate a certain definite Kingdom, and use it without the slightest intimation or explanation of a change in its meaning; and this employment of the phrases, with a correspondent Jewish meaning attached, continued (as admitted by our opponents, e.g. Prop. 20, Obs. 3, n. 1) at least down (Acts 1:6) to the ascension of Christ.
### Important fountain head
>Obs. 2. Here, at the very fountain head, in the presence and under the sanction of the Master Himself, there must be no discrepancy.

### Liberal views
Obs. 4

### Confirms early origin of the Gospels
>Obs. 5. The student is directed to a proof that this subject affords in behalf of the early origin of the Gospels.
