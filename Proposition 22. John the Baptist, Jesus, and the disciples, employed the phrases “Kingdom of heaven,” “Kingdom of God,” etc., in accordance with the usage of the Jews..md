# Proposition 22. John the Baptist, Jesus, and the disciples, employed the phrases “Kingdom of heaven,” “Kingdom of God,” etc., in accordance with the usage of the Jews.

>It is admitted by all authorities that this phraseology was current among the Jews, and was adopted by the first preachers of the Kingdom.
>p. 195 Vol. 1 Prop. 22
### From Daniel 7:13, 14
>Obs. 1. The Prop, needs no proof, for the fact is self-evident. First is to be found the well-known expectations of the Jews based on a literal interpretation of the prophecies; next, these are summed up in the expressive phrases “Kingdom of heaven,” etc., taken, as numerous writers inform us, from Dan. 7:13, 14; finally, John, Jesus, and others take *the very phraseology* adopted by the Jews to designate *a certain definite Kingdom*, and use it without the slightest intimation or explanation of *a change* in its meaning; and this employment of the phrases, with a correspondent Jewish meaning attached, continued (as admitted by our opponents, e.g. Prop. 20, Obs. 3, n. 1) at least down (Acts 1:6) to the ascension of Christ.
>p. 195 Vol. 1 Prop. 22 Obs. 1
### Important fountain head
>Obs. 2. Here, at the very fountain head, in the presence and under the sanction of the Master Himself, there must be *no discrepancy*.
>p. 195 Vol. 1 Prop. 22 Obs. 2
### A Jewish carnal idea? (apologists)
Obs. 3
>Apologists inform us (*Ecce Deus*, p. 329) that “Christ came to give that conception a profounder interpretation, and a more intensely spiritual bearing,” that “the Jew had a carnal idea of a spiritual fact.” But where is *the proof* of this carnality and substitution?
>p. 196 Vol. 1 Prop. 22 Obs. 3
### Liberal views
Obs. 4
### Confirms early origin of the Gospels
>Obs. 5. The student is directed to a proof that this subject affords in behalf of the early origin of the Gospels.
>p. 197 Vol. 1 Prop. 22 Obs. 5
