# Selected Quotations from "The Theocratic Kingdom"

It has been a pleasure spending much of my first full year in retirement taking a journey with George N. H. Peters to ponder the wonders of the kingdom of heaven.  He continuously points his readers to the King of this kingdom, the God who purposed it, the Scriptures by which God reveals it, the long history of those who believe it as revealed and those who do not.

I was briefly introduced to this work while taking a Bible class many years ago but was recently reminded of it while doing some other reading.  

**The Theocratic Kingdom** contains 206 propositions (i.e. chapters) and each proposition contains a set of observations (i.e. sections).  The proposition titles themselves are masterfully stated and well organized to deal with this major biblical topic.

These are **my selected quotations** from George N. H. Peters' great work **The Theocratic Kingdom**. Although I have inserted a **very few personal notes** and added **pericopes** to **most** of the observations, these are **mostly direct quotations** from Peters' three volume masterful work. I continue to make adjustments as I observe typos and other mistakes.

My desire is to give you enough taste so you also will take this journey by reading all 2100 pages of the printed work, **The Theocratic Kingdom**.  These selected quotations may also help you (as it has me) to review your journey from time to time, either along the way or looking back.

These notes are being captured in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (and are best viewed in Obsidian) but a subset of the complete notes have been exported into EPUB and PDF (see exports folder) for non-Obsidian viewing. The complete set of my notes can freely be obtained at [github](https://github.com/larryknaebelobsidian/kingdom). My notes are free and non-licensed.

May you come to trust and obey the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and grow in your loving hope of His return and kingdom.
