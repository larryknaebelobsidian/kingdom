# Selected Quotations from "The Theocratic Kingdom"

It has been a pleasure spending my first full year of retirement taking a journey with George N. H. Peters to discover the wonders of the kingdom of heaven.  He continuously points his readers to the King of this kingdom, the God who purposed it, the Scriptures by which God reveals it, the long history of those who believe it as revealed and of those who do not.

I was briefly introduced to this work while taking a Bible class many years ago but was recently reminded of it while doing some other reading.  

**The Theocratic Kingdom** contains 206 propositions (i.e. chapters) and each proposition contains a set of observations (i.e. sections).  The proposition titles themselves are masterfully stated and organized to deal with this major biblical topic and are worthy of memorization (although I have not).

These are my selected quotations from George N. H. Peters' great work **The Theocratic Kingdom**. Although I have inserted a very few personal notes and added pericopes to **most** of the observations these are mainly quotations from Peters' three volume masterful work. 

My desire is to give you enough taste so you also will take this journey by reading all 2100 pages of **The Theocratic Kingdom**.  These selected quotations may also help you to review your journey from time to time, either along the way or looking back.

May you come to trust and obey the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and grow in your loving hope of His return and kingdom.
