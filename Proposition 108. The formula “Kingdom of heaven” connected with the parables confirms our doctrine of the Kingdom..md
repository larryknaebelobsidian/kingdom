# Proposition 108. The formula “Kingdom of heaven” connected with the parables confirms our doctrine of the Kingdom.

>The contrary is asserted by all opposed to us, and as the Church-Kingdom view mainly obtains as a Scriptural basis its rise and defence from it, it deserves attention.
>p. 16 Vol. 2 Prop 108
### Preliminary thoughts
>Obs. 1. A few preliminary thoughts are, however, in place. 
>1. (1) The reader will recall our Prop, concerning the mysteries of the Kingdom. The parables were given respecting the secrets of the Kingdom and were in themselves designed *to conceal* some things that were necessary. Lange (*Com*., Matt. 13) correctly shows that the common notion (viz., that they were adapted to weak and carnal understandings) entertained, is erroneous. But Lange does not go far enough, for if we are to take the testimony of Jesus Himself, they were far from being designed for *popular* instruction, being in point of fact employed to conceal some very important truths. Jesus says that He spoke *plainly* to His disciples, but *in parables* to the people, clearly distinguishing between plain and hidden truth. In Matt. 13:13; Mark 4:11; Luke 8:10, He says that the parable is used that the people *may not* comprehend. The reason for this lies in their *foreknown* depravity and rejection of the Messiah, in their being *unable to receive* the intended postponement of the Kingdom and contemplated ingrafting of the Gentiles. To appreciate the parables in *all* their fulness it is *absolutely necessary* to keep in view the Covenant and the Divine Purpose in its fulfilment, as shown in previous Propositions. 
>2. (2) The depth of these parables cannot be apprehended unless we especially keep in mind what afterward occurred, viz., the *postponement* of the Kingdom, which, impressed by the foreknowledge of Jesus, gave *a coloring* to them highly marked and distinctive. 
>...
>p. 16 Vol. 2 Prop 108 Obs. 1

>(3) If the parables delineate the Kingdom of God in the Church as now currently believed, why is it that the Apostles did not *ascertain* this fact and use them as *now popularly* employed?
>p. 16 Vol. 2 Prop 108 Obs. 1

>(4) In this discussion, the vital difference that exists between our view and that of others is, that we hold that the parables teach what is *preparatory* or *introductory to* the Kingdom, whilst they maintain that the parables refer directly to a Kingdom already in existence, and describe its condition, etc.
>p. 17 Vol. 2 Prop 108 Obs. 1

>(5) We are not to be understood as basing our doctrine *on the parables*, ...
>p. 17 Vol. 2 Prop 108 Obs. 1

>(6) Covenant and prophecy promise *only one*, and that a permanent, Kingdom to the Messiah, David’s Son. Nothing is said of an inferior and then superior one, of one existing before the Sec. Advent as a prelude to another, of several successive stages in a progressive direction; for the decided impression made is, that *one Kingdom alone* is described as existing under "the reign of the Messiah."
>p. 18 Vol. 2 Prop 108 Obs. 1

>The parabolic form is *a convenient refuge* for all mystical interpretations,
>p. 18 Vol. 2 Prop 108 Obs. 1 (6)

>(7) Again, it must be borne in mind that quite a number of the parables, as many writers (especially Greswell) have shown, are *prophetical* in their nature.
>p. 18 Vol. 2 Prop 108 Obs. 1
### Not the same as "God's reign in the heart", etc.
>Obs. 2. If the Kingdom of God is what is so popularly represented, viz., “God’s rule,” or “God’s reign in the heart,” or “the body of believers,” *then*, as a matter of course, if they are synonymous, it would be appropriate to substitute one or the other of these in the place of the heading of the parables.
>p. 20 Vol. 2 Prop 108 Obs. 2

>... the Jews did not receive the truth because a spiritual Kingdom was presented in it for their acceptance, but for the reason that these parables, *before the setting up of the Kingdom*, imposed upon them preparatory duties and intimated a period of time to intervene, which was unpalatable to their hearts and expectations.
>p. 20 Vol. 2 Prop 108 Obs. 2
### Parables of "the Kingdom of Heaven"
p. 21 Vol. 2 Prop 108 Obs. 3

#### Leaven

Peters notes summary
- leaven = word of God
- 3 sata of flour = the complete collection of the saints
##### Leavening process is preparatory
>The most important of the parables is that of the Leaven
>p. 22 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 3

>... the parable corresponds with the preceding ones. As in usage the leavening process is only *a preparatory one*, so it is here; the leaven is the Divine Word of the “Kingdom, it leavens a definite measure of meal, i.e. a predetermined number who are to be adopted as the Sons of God. *The gathering out process, and the detention* of the Kingdom until this is accomplished, is thus presented, preserving *the unity* of Scripture. The leavened meal is *initiatory* to the formation of bread, so this Divine Process is *introductory* to the Divine Purpose of establishing the Kingdom. The people and the disciples are taught, that *previous* to the setting up of the Kingdom *a definite number of the elect* must first be obtained, and the manner in which this is done, by gradual appropriation through Divine truth, is also intimated. 
>p. 23 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 3 

>the Apostles who found this secret or mystery in the postponement and consequent call of the Gentiles, as is proven by Eph., 3:4-6; Col. 1:26, 27, etc., thus *fully according* with our interpretation.

>It again indicates a *preparatory* stage in the individual and that he can obtain an abiding interest, inheritance, in the Kingdom itself.
>p. 23 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 4

>Faith seizes upon the treasure God offers, and is willing to surrender all to obtain the abiding hope which it inspires, and its ultimate enjoyment.
>p. 24 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 4

>We prefer the common view, making it equivalent to take up the cross, denying ourselves, forsaking all for Christ, which is the practical evidence of an exercise of Christian faith.
>p. 28 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 4 note

The *design* of this dispensation is represented, the *postponement* indicated in a preparatory gathering which shall continue *until* the end of the age. The mixed condition until the final separation is a prominent feature. The Kingdom, owing to its rejection by the nation, requires *this previous casting of the net* and its results.

### Church-Kingdom theory engrafted on the parables
