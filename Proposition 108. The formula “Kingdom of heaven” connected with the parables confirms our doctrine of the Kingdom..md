- the kingdom comes at the period of the harvest
- kingdom = the final result, the end

#### Leaven
[Matt. 13:33](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matt.+13%3A33); [Luke 13:20-21](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+13%3A20-21)
Peters notes
- leaven = word of God
- 3 sata of flour = the complete collection of the saints

>The most important of the parables is that of the Leaven
>p. 22 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 

>the parable corresponds with the preceding ones. As in usage the leavening process is only *a preparatory one*, so it is here; the leaven is the Divine Word of the â€œKingdom, it leavens a definite measure of meal, i.e. a predetermined number who are to be adopted as the Sons of God. *The gathering out process, and the detention* of the Kingdom until this is accomplished, is thus presented, preserving *the unity* of Scripture. The leavened meal is *initiatory* to the formation of bread, so this Divine Process is *introductory* to the Divine Purpose of establishing the Kingdom. The people and the disciples are taught, that *previous* to the setting up of the Kingdom *a definite number of the elect* must first be obtained, and the manner in which this is done, by gradual appropriation through Divine truth, is also intimated. 
>p. 23 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 3 

>the .Apostles who found this secret or mystery in the postponement and consequent call of the Gentiles, as is proven by Eph., 3:4-6; Col. 1:26, 27, etc., thus *fully according* with our interpretation.
>p. 23 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 3

#### Treasure and Pearl
[Matt. 13:44-46](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matt.+13%3A44-46)
Peters notes
- treasure = kingdom
- pearl = kingdom

>as men exhibit their interest in, and willingness to sacrifice all for, something that is very precious and costly, so we ought to do the same *in behalf* of the Kingdom of God
>p. 23 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 4

>It again indicates a *preparatory* stage in the individual and that he can obtain an abiding interest, inheritance, in the Kingdom itself.
>p. 23 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 4

>Faith seizes upon the treasure God offers, and is willing to surrender all to obtain the abiding hope which it inspires, and its ultimate enjoyment.
>p. 24 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 4

>We prefer the common view, making it equivalent to take up the cross, denying ourselves, forsaking all for Christ.
>p. 28 Vol. 2 Prop. 108 Obs. 3 para. 4 note

>The parable of the Net, Matt. 13:47-50, resembles that of the Tares and Wheat, and therefore requires no explanation. The design of this dispensation is represented, the postponement indicated in a preparatory gathering which shall continue until the end of the age. The mixed condition until the final separation is a prominent feature. The Kingdom, owing to its rejection by the nation, requires this previous casting of the net and its results.
