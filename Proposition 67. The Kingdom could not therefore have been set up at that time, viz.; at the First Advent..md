# Proposition 67. The Kingdom could not therefore have been set up at that time, viz.; at the First Advent.

### Props Mentioned
56 57 58 59 
### Kingdom withdrawn and postponed at first advent
>Obs. 1. In Matt. 12:28 (Luke 11:20), when the Jews had taken counsel to kill Jesus, He cast out a devil and was accused by the Jews of performing miracles through the power of Satan. In self-defence, showing that this very power was necessary to Him *who would* establish the Kingdom, He says: “*But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God*” (Luke: “the finger of God”), “*then the Kingdom of God is come unto you*” (Luke "*upon you*”) i.e. it was tendered to them on condition of repentance and Christ’s miraculous power evinced the ability to verify the offer of it.
>...
>it has come “unto or upon them” both in the tender and in the manifested power and person of the Messiah; ...
>p. 421 Vol. 1 Prop 67 Obs. 1
### Not withdrawn permanently
>Obs. 2. But this taking away of the Kingdom from the nation (then unworthy), and the giving of it to others (in a special sense, i.e. as inheritors, as will appear in the course of our argument), must not be pressed, as the reader has already been warned, to the extent that the Kingdom will *never again* be established with this Jewish nation restored to God’s favor. For this would *nullify God’s covenants and oath, and vitiate Christ’s inheritance*.
>p. 421-422 Vol. 1 Prop 67 Obs. 2
### The Jewish nation not yet ready - Times of the Gentiles
>Obs. 3. The Kingdom could not be set up, because it required (according to the Theocratic ordering and the Davidic covenant accepting and incorporating it) *a nation*, and that one *the Jewish nation* (to whom alone it is covenanted), before it could be re-established in a most glorious form under the Messiah.
>p. 422 Vol. 1 Prop 67 Obs. 3
### God's condescension to earth as ruler did not happen at first advent 
>Obs. 4. The Kingdom being thus postponed, *no Theocracy* was established. Men, indeed, claim this for the church, but this is a grave mistake and misleading. Let the reader refer to our Propositions on the Theocracy and he will see that the leading essential element, that which constituted a Theocracy, was the fact *that God condescended to act as an earthly Ruler*. Now it is self-evident that no such distinctive feature was inaugurated at the First Advent.
