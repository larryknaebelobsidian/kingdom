# Proposition 110. The passage most relied on to prove the Church-Kingdom theory utterly disproves it.

>Desirous to call especial attention to this passage of Scripture, it is reserved for a separate Proposition. In a careful reading and study of the Church-Kingdom theory, it will be found *the most frequently* quoted, and adduced as an authority, from Origen down to recent writers as Dr. McCosh, and including a host. In view of the learning, ability, and high standing of those who thus employ it, this Scripture (viz., Luke 17:21) deserves marked attention.
>p. 39 Vol. 2 Prop 110
#### Luke 17:20-21
Now having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, “The kingdom of God is not coming with _signs to be_ observed, 21 nor will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘There!’ For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.”
### "Within" the elect nation
>... how this Kingdom was “*within*” them. It was truly “*within*” the nation, it being the elect nation. The persons addressed were part of the nation and chief men of it, and Christ, *in strict accordance with* covenant relationship and fact, told those very unbelievers, that in view of *the tender* of this Kingdom to the people of the nation, and of its being preached within the nation, and of its being identified with the nation in the throne and Kingdom of David, this Kingdom is within them.
>p. 42 Vol. 2 Prop 110 Obs. 2

>It is *connected with them, and within their reach* on condition of repentance. It is also equivalent to the expression in Luke 11:20, “*the Kingdom of God is come upon you*” or Matt. 12:28, “*come unto you*” i.e. has attained unto you or pertains to you. The word “within” receives its force from *the restriction* thrown around the Kingdom *by the covenant relationship* of the nation, and therefore it has or it is, come “*upon*” them, “*among*” them, “*within*” them, as it could not at that time come to any other nation or people. This is evidenced from the fact that this very Kingdom thus come *within* the nation is taken *from* it and given to another engrafted people. If it did not *in a high and peculiar* sense *belong* to the nation, it could not be taken *from* it. Hence the “*within you*” addressed to these unbelieving Jews is *most expressive of their covenanted relationship and the glorious privileges* that they as a nation enjoyed. Restricted as it was to that nation, *the opportunity* was presented of a blessed change, but instead of repentance and faith and a consequent establishment of the Kingdom, a sad history of wickedness intervened.

>If the *context following* is noticed it confirms our interpretation. He *now* addresses the disciples: “*the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it* ’ (v. 22). This, *in reply* to the question *when* the Kingdom shall come, indicates what we have already proven, *the indefinite postponement* of the Kingdom; for the line of Christ’s remarks makes the decided impression that the Kingdom will *not soon* be established, owing to His departure, and *that the time of His return and its manifestation is concealed*.
>p. 42 Vol. 2 Prop 110 Obs. 2

>... the Kingdom *was nigh* to the Jewish nation, that, owing to their sinfulness, it *was not established but is postponed* to an indefinite period in the future, viz., “*to the day when the Son of man is revealed*” (comp. Props. 56-68).

### "Observed"
Obs. 3
>... the multitude engraft on the original word such expressions as “outward show,” “splendor,” “pomp,” “outward display,” “external display of majesty,” etc., which do not legitimately belong to the word translated “observation,” but are given to it, *to suit* a theory, on the ground *that such things are observed*!
>p. 44 Vol. 2 Prop 110 Obs. 3

>(1) This secondary sense is *not true* even of the Church. The Church comes with observation, as e.g. on the day of Pentecost.
>...
>(2) This secondary sense is *not correct* concerning the Kingdom of Christ. Let the reader notice what the Covenant demands, what the prophets predict, respecting this Kingdom. Is it not to come with such “outward show,” such “splendor” and “external majesty,” that it shall arrest the attention of, and be witnessed by, all living?

Within the elect Jewish nation
### Not the Christian church

### Urge for watchfulness

>... Luke 21:31; “*So likewise, ye when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand*.” Having already used this passage in sustaining the postponement of the Kingdom, it is only necessary to say that neither the Church, visible or invisible, nor “God’s reign in the heart,” could be denoted, since “*these things*” specified are running their course down to the present day.
>...
>These signs, not of the Kingdom itself but of things existing when it is to come, will be enumerated under another Proposition (comp. Props. 173 and 174).
