NOTE: Scripture quotes from LSB

### [Dan. 2:31-45](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Dan.+2%3A31-45)
“You, O king, were looking, and behold, there was a single great image; that image, which was large and of extraordinary splendor, was rising up in front of you, and its appearance was awesome. 32 The head of that image _was made_ of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. 34 You continued looking until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed all at the same time and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. 36 “This _was_ the dream; now we will say its interpretation before the king. 37 You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory; 38 and wherever the sons of men inhabit, _or_ the beasts of the field, or the birds of the sky, He has given _them_ into your hand and has made you rule with power over them all. You are the head of gold. 39 But after you there will arise another kingdom inferior to you, then another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule with power over all the earth. 40 Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters all things, so, like iron that breaks in pieces, it will crush and break all these in pieces. 41 Now in that you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron; it will be a divided kingdom; but it will have in it the toughness of iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with common clay. 42 _And as_ the toes of the feet _were_ partly of iron and partly of clay, _so_ some of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle. 43 And in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay; they will combine with one another in the seed of men; but they will not cling to one another, even as iron does not combine with clay. 44 And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will cause a kingdom to rise up which will never be destroyed, and _that_ kingdom will not be left for another people; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, but it will itself stand forever. 45 Inasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will happen in the future; so the dream is certain, and its interpretation is trustworthy.”

### [Dan. 7:1-28](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Dan.+7%3A1-28) 
In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions in his head _as he lay_ on his bed; then he wrote the dream down _and_ said the _following_ summary of the matter. 2 Daniel answered and said, “I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. 3 And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another. 4 The first _was_ like a lion and had _the_ wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; and a heart of a man was given to it. 5 And behold, another beast, a second one in the likeness of a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs _were_ in its mouth between its teeth; and thus they said to it, ‘Arise, devour much meat!’ 6 After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it. 7 After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, fearsome and terrifying and extraordinarily strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. 8 While I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great _boasts_. 9 “I kept looking Until thrones were set up, And the Ancient of Days was seated; His clothing _was_ like white snow And the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne _was_ ablaze with fire, Its wheels _were_ a burning fire. 10 A river of fire was flowing And coming out from before Him; Thousands upon thousands were attending Him, And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him;
The court sat, And the books were opened.
11 Then I kept looking because of the sound of the great _boastful_ words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was killed, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire. 12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for an appointed season of time.
13 “I kept looking in the night visions, And behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, And He came up to the Ancient of Days And came near before Him.
14 And to Him was given dominion, Glory, and a kingdom, That all the peoples, nations, and _men of every_ tongue Might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion
Which will not be taken away; And His kingdom is one Which will not be destroyed.
15 “As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me, and the visions of my head kept alarming me. 16 I came near to one of those who were standing by and began seeking out _from_ him the exact meaning of all this. So he said _it_ to me and made known to me the interpretation of these things: 17 ‘These great beasts, which are four _in number_, are four kings _who_ will arise from the earth. 18 But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, for all ages to come.’ 19 “Then I desired to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, extraordinarily fearsome, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, _and which_ devoured, crushed, and trampled down the remainder with its feet, 20 and _the meaning_ of the ten horns that _were_ on its head and the other _horn_ which came up and before which three _of them_ fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth speaking great _boasts_ and which was larger in appearance than its associates. 21 I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the saints and overcoming them 22 until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the season arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom. 23 “Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, which will be different from all the _other_ kingdoms and will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it. 24 As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will make low three kings. 25 He will speak words against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make changes in seasons and in law; and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time. 26 But the court will sit _for judgment_, and his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever. 27 Then the reign, the dominion, and the greatness of _all_ the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom _will be_ an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.’ 28 “At this point the matter _of this revelation_ ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me, and the splendor of my _face_ changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.

### [Isa. 25:6-9](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Isa.+25%3A6-9)
And Yahweh of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain;
A banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow, _And_ refined, aged wine.
7 And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples,
Even the veil which is stretched over all nations.
8 He will swallow up death for all time, And Lord Yahweh will wipe tears away from all faces, And He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth; For Yahweh has spoken.
9 And it will be said in that day, “Behold, this is our God in whom we have hoped that He would save us. This is Yahweh in whom we have hoped; Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.”

### [Isa. 2:1-5](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Isa.+2%3A1-5)
The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz beheld concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 2
Now it will be that In the last days The mountain of the house of Yahweh Will be established as the head of the mountains, And will be lifted up above the hills; And all the nations will stream to it.
3 And many peoples will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, To the house of the God of Jacob, That He may instruct us from His ways And that we may walk in His paths.” For from Zion the law will go forth And the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem. 4 And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war. 5 Come, house of Jacob, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.

### [Micah 4:1-8](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=micah+4%3A1-8)
Now it will be that in the last days
The mountain of the house of Yahweh
Will be established as the head of the mountains,
And will be lifted up above the hills,
And the peoples will stream to it.
2 And many nations will come and say,
“Come and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh
And to the house of the God of Jacob,
That He may instruct us from His ways
And that we may walk in His paths.”
For from Zion will go forth the law,
And the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
3 And He will judge between many peoples
And will render decisions for mighty, distant nations.
And they will hammer their swords into plowshares
And their spears into pruning hooks;
Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
And never again will they learn war.
4 And each of them will sit under his vine
And under his fig tree,
With no one to make _them_ tremble,
For the mouth of Yahweh of hosts has spoken.
5 Though all the peoples walk
Each in the name of his god,
As for us, we will walk
In the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.
6 “In that day,” declares Yahweh,
“I will assemble the lame
And gather the banished,
Even those _upon_ whom I have brought calamity.
7 I will make the lame a remnant
And the outcasts a mighty nation,
And Yahweh will reign over them in Mount Zion
From now on and forever.
8 And as for you, tower of the flock,
Hill of the daughter of Zion,
To you it will come⁠—
Even the former dominion will come,
The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.

### [Zech. 14:1-21](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zech.+14%3A1-21)
Behold, a day is coming for Yahweh when the spoil _taken_ from you will be divided among you.2 Indeed, I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished, and half of the city will go forth in exile, but those left of the people will not be cut off from the city.3 Then Yahweh will go forth and fight against those nations, as the day when He fights on a day of battle.4 And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.5 And you will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; indeed, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then Yahweh, my God, will come, _and_ all the holy ones with Him!6 And it will be in that day, _that_ there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.7 And it will be a unique day which is known to Yahweh, neither day nor night, but it will be that at evening time there will be light.8 And it will be in that day, _that_ living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter.
9 And Yahweh will be king over all the earth; in that day Yahweh will be _the only_ one, and His name one.10 All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and inhabit its site from Benjamin’s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s wine presses.11 And people will inhabit it, and there will no longer be _anything_ devoted to destruction, for Jerusalem will be inhabited in security.12 Now this will be the plague with which Yahweh will plague all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.13 And it will be in that day, _that_ abundant confusion from Yahweh will fall on them; and they will take hold of one another’s hand, and the hand of one will go up against the hand of another.14 And Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.15 And in the same way, the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey, and all the cattle that will be in those camps will be like this plague.16 Then it will be that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Yahweh of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.17 And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh of hosts, there will be no rain on them.18 And if the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no _rain will fall_ on them; it will be the plague with which Yahweh plagues the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.19 This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.20 In that day there will _be inscribed_ on the bells of the horses, “Holy to Yahweh.” And the pots in the house of Yahweh will be like the bowls before the altar.21 And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Yahweh of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of Yahweh of hosts in that day.

### [Isa. 63:1-6](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Isa.+63%3A1-6)
Who is this who comes from Edom,
With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah,
This One who is majestic in His clothing,
Marching in the greatness of His power?
“It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.”
2 Why is Your clothing red,
And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press?
3 “I have trodden the wine trough alone,
And from the peoples there was no man with Me.
I also trod them in My anger
And trampled them in My wrath;
And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments,
And I stained all My clothes.
4 For the day of vengeance was in My heart,
And My year of redemption has come.
5 I looked, and there was no one to help,
And I was astonished, and there was no one to uphold;
So My own arm brought salvation to Me,
And My wrath upheld Me.
6 I trod down the peoples in My anger
And made them drunk in My wrath,
And I brought down their lifeblood to the earth.”


>We remind the reader of one fact as fully presented in past Propositions, and demonstrated *both* historically and scripturally, viz. : That the view we take of the prophecies pertaining to the Kingdom accords in every respect with those entertained by the Church in the first centuries.  It is passing strange, to say the least, that the early believers, east and west, north and south, should, under the leadership of men who organized and perpetuated the Church, place, as we do, the fulfillment of those predictions *at the Sec. Advent of Jesus*, and not, as many now do, at the founding of the Ch. Church. These prophecies, too, are so prominent, so magnificent in proportions, such landmarks in the Divine Redemptive plan, that they must have largely occupied the attention of the apostolic and succeeding age.
