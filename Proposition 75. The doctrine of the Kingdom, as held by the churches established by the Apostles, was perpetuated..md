# Proposition 75. The doctrine of the Kingdom, as held by the churches established by the Apostles, was perpetuated.
### All the orthodox of the early church fathers adopted Chiliasm
>So extensively, so generally was Chiliasm perpetuated, that Justin Martyr *positively asserts that all the orthodox* adopted and upheld it.
> . . .
>"But I and whatsoever Christians *are orthodox in all things* do know that there will be a resurrection of the flesh, and a thousand years in the city of Jerusalem, built, adorned and enlarged, according as Ezekiel, Isaiah, and other prophets have promised. For Isaiah saith of this thousand years (ch. 65:17), ‘Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into, mind; but be ye glad and rejoice in those which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem to triumph, and my people to rejoice,” etc. Moreover, a certain man among us, whose name is *John, being one of the twelve apostles of Christ*, in that revelation which was shown to him prophesied, that those who believe in our Christ shall fulfil a thousand years at Jerusalem; and *after that* the general, and, in a word, the everlasting resurrection, and last judgment of all together. Whereof also *our Lord spake* when He said, that therein they shall neither marry, nor be given in marriage, but shall be equal with the angels, being made the sons of the resurrection of God.”
>--Justin Martyr 
>p. 480 Vol. 1 Prop. 75 Obs. 1
### Confirmed by Jerome
>Jerome (*Com. on Jes.*, 19:10), says: “that he durst *not condemn the (Millennial) doctrine, because many ecclesiastical persons and martyrs affirm the same*.”
>p. 484 Vol. 1 Prop. 75 Obs. 4
### "The chiliastic period of Apocalyptic interpretation"
>Dr. Smith (*N. Test. His.*, p. 723, *On Rev.*) remarks: “The interval between the Apostolic age and that of Constantine has been called *the Chiliastic period* of Apocalyptic interpretation.”
>p. 484 Vol. 1 Prop. 75 Obs. 5
### Witnessed by the Apocryphal books
>Obs. 6. The extent to which the doctrine prevailed is also apparent from the Apocryphal books. The counterfeit is based upon the genuine.
>p. 486 Vol. 1 Prop. 75 Obs. 6
### Received by Gentile churches as heartily as Jewish
>The Gentile Christian churches down to the third century (until Caius, Origen, and Dionysius), received it *just as freely* and entertained it *just as heartily as the Jewish* Christian.
>p. 486 Vol. 1 Prop. 75 Obs. 7
### Opposed in third and following centuries
>Although the doctrine was opposed in the third and following centuries, yet it continued for some time to have *many* who held to it. The custom of Christians, as Tertullian informs us, to pray “*that they might have part in the first resurrection,*" was not easily rooted out, for, as *Cyprian* (about A.D. 220) tells us, the thirst for martyrdom was increased by the hope that suffering for Christ would entail a more distinguished lot in His coming Kingdom.
>p. 491 Vol. 1 Prop. 75 Obs. 9
### Lack of continual orthodoxy is proof of falsity
>Obs. 11. It has been observed by some that this doctrine of the early church, if true, should have been continuously presented in a prominent orthodox form (i.e., confessionally), and because not so held, it cannot be true. But this entirely overlooks the predicted *defection* from the truth (as e.g. 2 Thess. 2, 2 Tim. 4:3, 4, etc.), and the warnings given to us to return to the truth as *previously* imparted; it elevates the mere deductions and confessional position of the church above *that of the Scriptures* in its covenants and prophecies; it forgets that the probationary attitude of man and the exercise of his will has *an important* bearing, making a rejection of truth possible; and it ignores the fact, that precisely the same line of argument which applies to a foretold apostatizing from truth, and to the propriety (necessity) and good results of a revival of doctrine by the Reformation, can, *with equal force*, be used in the defence of this single doctrine.
>p. 492 Vol. 1 Prop. 75 Obs. 11
### Must be rejected due to relatively small following
>Obs. 12. It has been alleged by others, that, taking the church as a whole, and considering the vast multitude since the days of the apostles that have rejected the doctrine, but comparatively *a small number* have held to this view of the Kingdom;—and, hence, it ought to be rejected.
>p. 493 Vol. 1 Prop. 75 Obs. 12
### Pre-Mill Advocates of the first century, second century, and third century
>... in the closing years of the 2d century men arose who started an antagonism distinctively presented and urged in the 3d cent., and which culminated in the 4th and succeeding centuries.
>p. 497 Vol. 1 Prop. 75 Obs. 13

>... in the Catholic Church the doctrine of the 1000 years’ Kingdom was *the dominant doctrine*, and the rejection of it was regarded as an approach to Gnosticism.
>p. 498 Vol. 1 Prop. 75 Obs. 14
