>This is seen in the fact that our doctrine makes much of what Christ is yet to do at His Sec. Advent.

>But our view embraces not merely the completion of salvation in the saints of this and former ages by experiencing the resurrection, etc., but includes salvation in restoration to all forfeited blessings pertaining to saints, to the Jewish nation and the race. The Kingdom itself, while embracing salvation, becomes the medium of salvation to the world. When this period of re-establishment comes, then to the preparatory work of Christ is added the direct supernatural Theocratic power by which deliverance is obtained and evermore sustained.
### "The Salvation"
>Obs. 1. The careful student will have noticed that the Jews before and at the Advent of Jesus were accustomed to designate the period or results when the throne and Kingdom of David should be restored under the Messiah, as “the Salvation.”

>The Kingdom of the Messiah and salvation were in the Jewish mind convertible terms;
>Obs. 1


>The term “salvation,” correctly apprehended by the primitive Church, was from Origen’s time applied too much to the present life and to the intermediate state.
>Obs. 1
### Now an "earnest"
>The reader will notice, as e.g. in Eph. 1:13, 14; Phil. 1:27-29, that, whatever we now receive from “the Gospel of salvation,” it is only “the earnest” of the distinguishing salvation—the specific salvation—held forth by the covenant and promises.
>Obs. 2

>the intermediate state, whatever it may be, with the body in the grave, the non-fulfilment of covenant promises, the postponement of the reign on earth, etc., the saint is not enjoying the predicted inheritance, crown, reward, etc., only to be given at the Sec. Advent.
>Obs. 2

>The great, the emphatic salvation is then still future, and hence, the work of Christ, is not yet completed. The solid foundation is indeed laid, the preparatory work is progressing, but the lime for the perfect realization of salvation has not yet arrived.
>Obs. 2
### Salvation includes the Second Advent
>Obs. 3. The apostles not only freely adopt the current phraseology of the Jews concerning salvation—thus endorsing them—but in the most positive manner point out that the expected salvation to which the tribes hope to come is delayed to the Sec. Advent.
>Obs. 3
### Some prophecies
>Obs. 4. Seeing that the apostles refer the salvation spoken of by the prophets to the time of the Sec. Advent, it may be corroborative of our position to glance at some of the prophecies which describe it, and notice, briefly, what things are included under the phrase.

>Isa. 25:9
>1. the reign of the Messiah in Jerusalem, 
>2. the resurrection of the righteous, 
>3. the overthrow of all enemies, 
>4. universal dominion, etc.
>Obs. 4 reformatted

>Ps. 9:14
>1. “the lifting up from the gates of death,” 
>2. the removal of enemies, 
>3. the judging of the world in righteousness, etc.
>Obs. 4

>Ps. 37:39
>the inheriting of the earth when the wicked are utterly rooted out of it.
>Obs. 4

>Ps. 98:2
>When “the Lord makes known His salvation” Ps. 98:2 it is, when He comes “to judge the earth,” when He has done “marvellous things,” and “His right hand and His holy arm hath gotten Him the victory,” and “tie hath remembered His mercy and His truth toward the house of Israel.”
>Obs. 4

>Ps. 118:14,
>When “the Lord becomes our salvation” Ps. 118:14, He overthrows the confederation of nations that compass the righteous, He remembers mercy for the elect nation and doeth valiantly; the righteous “shall not die but live,” for He will not give them “over unto death.”
>Obs. 4

>Ps. 132:10,
>“When God will “clothe the Priests with salvation” Ps. 132:10, it is said that David’s Son shall sit upon David’s throne, “for the Lord hath chosen Zion, He hath desired it for His habitation. This is my rest forever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it”—“there will I make the horn of David to bud” and “His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon Himself shall His crown flourish,” etc.
>Obs. 4

>Ps. 149:4,
>At the time the Lord “will beautify (comp. 2 Thess. 1:10) the meek with salvation” Ps. 149:4, then 1. Israel will rejoice in their King, 
>2. the saints will be joyful in glory, and 
>3. the honor of executing judgment is conferred upon them.
>Obs. 4

>One of the most mournful and pathetic representations of the downfall of the nation, the desolations of Zion, the treading down of God’s own inheritance, is found in Ps. 74,
>Obs. 4

>Such references could be multiplied, the prophets being filled with them, in which this salvation is connected with 
>1. the Coming of the Lord, 
>2. the resurrection of saints, 
>3. the entire removal of enemies, 
>4. the return of the Jewish nation, and
>5. the restoration of the Davidic-Theocratic order under the Messiah, 
>6. the universal dominion and blessedness resulting out of this arrangement, 
>7. the removal of the curse, and 
>8. the regaining of Edenic conditions, 
>9. the bestowment of additional honor, power, glory.
>Obs. 4 reformatted

>surely the early Church was consistent and logical when it thus received and understood “salvation,” and looked for Jesus to come and finish the work so happily begun.
>Obs. 4

### Fulfill the covenants and prophets
>Obs. 5. An essential part of the work of Christ, is to fulfil the covenants and the prophets. This He has done to a certain extent, and is now performing in the Church and world, but the most remarkable and desirable portion is still unfulfilled. The sealing of the covenant with His own precious blood, etc., is exceedingly precious, but the fulfilment of the covenant in actual realization is described as blessed beyond description.

### Restoring the Kingdom of God
>Obs. 6. The work of Jesus is also that of restoring the Kingdom of God, as instanced, e.g. Acts 15:16.

>The titles of Messiah, Christ, Lord, and King, whatever applicability they may have to the present, have reference to this specific appointed work of rebuilding the fallen tabernacle of David and reigning over it, bringing all nations, through it, in willing subjection to His worldwide dominion. Even the names of Jesus, Saviour, and Redeemer assume a deeper significancy, when the power of the first resurrection, the bestowment of Kingship and priesthood, the actual inheriting of the Kingdom and its attendant blessings, are experienced.
>Obs. 6

>Obs. 7. The work of Jesus, which is to “destroy the works of the devil” (1 John 3:8), is only partially performed.

>Modern theology has too much confined the work of Christ in the destroying the works of the devil to this dispensation or intermediate period, and overlooking, or, underrating what Christ is yet to do (directly and by supernatural power, which alone can reach those works), in order to accomplish this work.
>Obs. 7

>Obs. 8. The sacrifice made by Christ on the cross, is more fully and effectively presented in this Kingdom.

### Eternal priesthood of Christ
>Obs. 9. The continuance of the saving work of Christ in the age to come, is confirmed by the eternal priesthood of Christ.

### Redemption is both spiritual and temporal
>Obs. 11. The benefits resulting from the work of Christ are both spiritual and temporal; refer to soul, body, race, and earth.

>To confine Redemption exclusively to one aspect, either spiritual or temporal, is to make it one-sided and imperfect; both must be included to give a perfect representation.
>Obs. 11

>To confine Redemption exclusively to one aspect, either spiritual or temporal, is to make it one-sided and imperfect; both must be included to give a perfect representation.
>Obs. 11
### No future atoning work of Christ
>we must not be understood (as already intimated in the Prop, on sacrifices) as including in that future work any additional atoning work.
>Obs. 12
