### Obs. 6
The ***note*** on observation 6 enumerates 43 ***reasons why the study of Prophecy is important***.
p. 170 Vol. 1 Prop. 17 Obs. 6 note

### Obs. 7
> The nature, characteristics, etc., of the Kingdom, should not be determined by one, two, or even more, predictions, unless very specific, but by a comparison of all, or at least a large number of, the predictions relating to it. One or more, taken separately, may give us but slight evidence, whilst the whole, or a large proportion, will present such abundant proof that the correctness of view will be fortified against assault.
> p. 171 Vol. 1 Prop. 17 Obs. 7

> the rule of comparison is essential to preserve from error

> Bh. Van Mildert says: "The the sense of no prophecy is to be determined by an abstract consideration of the passage itself; but by taking it in conjunction with other portions of Scripture relating to the subject."
