# Proposition 17. Without study of the prophecies, no adequate idea can be obtained of the kingdom.
### A Revelation of God's will and purpose
>Obs. 2. Prophecy takes higher ground than that of merely being a prediction of the future, or a witness to the truth, or a message of hope. Whilst all this, it is above all *a Revelation of God’s Will and Purpose*; and, therefore, while the preceding flow from it, a still grander result is attained when combining and linking together the predictions of God. Then we find, from first to last, that they publish a predetermined counsel of God, *a great Redemptive Process*, all centering in the predestined King and Kingdom.

p. 170 Vol. 1 Prop. 17 Obs. 6 note
### Comparison of passages is very important
> The nature, characteristics, etc., of the Kingdom, should not be determined by one, two, or even more, predictions, unless very specific, but by a comparison of all, or at least a large number of, the predictions relating to it. One or more, taken separately, may give us but slight evidence, whilst the whole, or a large proportion, will present such abundant proof that the correctness of view will be fortified against assault.

> ... the rule of comparison is essential to preserve from error
> p. 171 Vol. 1 Prop. 17 Obs. 7 note

> Bh. Van Mildert says: "That the sense of no prophecy is to be determined by an abstract consideration of the passage itself; but by taking it in conjunction with other portions of Scripture relating to the subject."

### Literal fulfillment of prophecy stressed by millenarians
>Obs. 9. Millenarians, in order to secure the belief of others, constantly appeal to a literal fulfilment of prophecy. They indorse the language of Tertullian (*Apol*. ch. 20): “The daily fulfilment of prophecy is, surely, a full proof of revelation. Hence, then, we have a well-founded belief in many things which are yet to come, namely, the confidence arising from our knowledge of the past, because some events, still future, were foretold at the same time with others which are past. The voice of prophecy speaks alike of each; the Scriptures record them equally; the same Spirit taught the prophets both. In the predictions there is no distinction of time; if there be any such distinction, it is made by men; while the gradual course of time makes that present which was future, and that past which was present. How can we, then, be blamed for believing also what is predicted respecting the future, when our confidence is founded upon the fulfilment of prophecies relating to the present and the past” (quoted by Cumming’s *Lect. on Dan*., p. 425, from Chevallier’s Trans.). We lay much stress on this feature in the present work.
