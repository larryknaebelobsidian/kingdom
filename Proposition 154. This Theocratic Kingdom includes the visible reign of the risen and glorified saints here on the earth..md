## Props Mentioned
[[Proposition 171. This Kingdom is connected with the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and of Fire.|171]] 

>the Theocratic king will also have His associated rulers assuring the moat ‘perfect administration of the laws, and securing the most perfect government, government, productive of peace, prosperity, and happiness, such as the world has never yet witnessed.
>p. 570 Vol. 2 Prop. 154

>The Word emphatically teaches that those thus chosen, accounted worthy of this rulership, are the saints. They are “joint heirs” (Rom. 8:17) with the Christ, who graciously divides, without marring His own superiority and supremacy (but rather exalts it thereby), His own inheritance with them.
>p. 570 Vol. 2 Prop. 154

>Hence, to inherit with the Christ, has a most deep and precious significancy, indicative of joint rulership with Him in His coming Kingdom. To be inheritors with Christ in His Kingdom evinces the astonishing wisdom of God in the Plan of Redemption, that without doing violence either to His moral government or to the free agency of fallen man, he raises up and purifies a material which, when the time comes, is employed in perpetuating the purity, holiness, etc., of a Divine-Human government again restored with untold grandeur to a needy, groaning world.
>p. 570 Vol. 2 Prop. 154

- “reign with Him” 
- “to sit on His throne” 
- “to be ruler over His goods,” 
- “ruler over many things” 
- “to have power over and rule nations” 
- to be “crowned,” 
- to be “Kings” and “Judges” and “Princes,” 
- “to inherit and possess a Kingdom,”

### When - at Second Advent after the first resurrection
>it occurs at the Second Advent, and after the first resurrection.
>p. 572 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 2


### Where - on the earth
>The place where this reign is to be manifested is expressly stated: “We shall reign on (or as Stuart, over) the earth.” In the very nature of the case, if they inherit with David’s Son, the restored Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom, it must be a reign here on and over the earth.
>p. 574 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 3

### The LORD will come and all the holy ones with him
Zech. 14:5
Joel 3:11; Matt. 24:30, 31; 2 Thess. 2:1; 1 Thess. 4:16, 17,

>Reference is again made to this in order that the reader may consider that “heirship of a Kingdom,” and “the inheriting of a Kingdom” embraces much more than a mere admittance into and enjoyment of the blessings of a Kingdom. It evinces the coming into such actual possession of a Kingdom as is alone met by the idea of a participancy in government and of regal authority.
>p. 578 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 5

>Thus Rev. 2:26-27 And he that overcometh and keepeth My words unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in shivers, even as I received from My Father.”
>p. 578 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 5

>So also the Psalmist (Ps. 140:5-9) makes “the saints joyful in glory” at the appearance of “their king” and declares: 45 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written:—this honor have all His saints. Praise ye the Lord”
>p. 578 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 5

### Judgement given to the saints
Obs. 6

>The wonderful Plan of God is shown in gathering out an elect body which shall, in the Coming Theocracy, be associated with the Christ in rulership in order to promote the redemptive process of the race, and to fill the earth with the praises and glory of the Lord. Instead of being defeated in His Theocratic purpose, God has been steadily making preparation for its sudden and overwhelming appearance.
>p. 587-588 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 8

### Spared Jews and Gentiles form the willing subjects of the Kingdom
>the Jewish and spared Gentile nations form the willing subjects of the Kingdom.
>p. 588 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 8

>The taunt employed in the early Church (evidently derived from this doctrinal feature) that Christians were a “genus tertium” a class elevated above others, is, after all, but sober truth.
>p. 588 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 8

>Therefore, it is that the lengthening out of this dispensation is represented as so gracious and merciful in God, in order that these destined rulers may be duly gathered even from among the Gentiles.
>p. 588 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 8

>The Kingdom itself is purposely delayed for thousands of years (long to man, but brief to God), in order to raise up this body of rulers to sustain it when manifested with a parity, dignity, power, stability, and glory worthy of a Theocracy. If the question be asked, why did not God establish the Theocracy in such a form in the time of Moses, or of David, or at the First Advent, the answer, as testified to by history, is apparent, viz., that man was not prepared for it. The essential element to sustain and give it its immortal, enduring characteristics had not yet been prepared and gathered. Looking at the predictions and promises, at the Kingdom as it shall appear, we see at once that a Theocracy with such a Ruler—God man—and with such associated kings and priests requires, in view of the intelligent freedom of man and his bias to sin, a period of preparation, a set time in which an elect, peculiar, royal people may be gathered. God could, as asserted, have raised up this body, if necessary, even “out of stones,” but He chooses rather in forbearance and wonderful patience to raise them up out of depraved man, not by compulsion or a forcing of the will, but by the application of His own truth to their self-consciousness and free will.
>p. 589 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 9

>When elevated to this kingship, it will be found that the state of probation, the constant contact with and conflict against evil, was most admirably adapted to qualify these rulers for their stations; not only as to their own personal relationship to each other, but likewise to bring them into sympathy with the nations of the earth. The physical and moral evil encountered, the valuable experience obtained, the relative change realized, the characteristics developed and confirmed, these, with the abundant additions of the Spirit, qualify them for the honor of kingship and priesthood, making them intelligent and wise kings, sympathetic and loving priests.
>p. 590 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 10

>This exaltation to a joint Theocratic rulership with David’s Son is an honor so unspeakably great that it should most deeply affect the heart of the believer. To be associated with the “King of kings” to be enthroned with the Mighty One, to be a Ruler with such an august Personage, this, indeed, is dignity and grandeur far beyond that ever attained by mortal monarch.
>p. 592 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 11

>Every believer, who runs the race successfully, is heir to a kingdom, heir to a substantial kingship.
>p. 593-594 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 12

>The wicked shall see the glory and feel the authority of these saints. This is abundantly evident from the action of these saints at the Second Advent, ruling the nations with a rod of iron, etc.
>p. 594 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 13

>They shall receive the promised Baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire (Prop. 171).
>p. 595 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 14

>God’s equity is vindicated by this reign of the saints.
>p. 596 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 15

>Indeed, this subject serves to throw light on the difficult subject of Divine Providence. For it indicates that evil cannot, and will not, ultimately triumph; its limits are definitely fixed. Owing to the proposed Theocracy being postponed until a number of chosen ones are gathered, and in view of these elect ones being tested in order to develop the character required by their subsequent Theocratic relationship, evil is allowed to the righteous as a source of trial to qualify them for their future positions,
>p. 596 Vol. 2 Prop. 154 Obs. 16
