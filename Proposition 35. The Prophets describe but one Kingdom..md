# Proposition 35. The Prophets describe but one Kingdom.

> . . . there is no writer, within our knowledge, who has ventured to suggest that *two* Kingdoms are denoted.
> p. 245 Vol. 1 Prop. 35
### One kingdom under the Messiah linked with Jewish nationality
>Obs. 1. There is one Kingdom under the Messiah, David’s Son and Lord, in some way linked with the election of the Jewish nationality, which is the great burden of prophecy.
### On earth
>This Kingdom, too, according to the grammatical sense, is one here *on the earth*, not somewhere else, as e.g. in the third heaven or the Universe.
>p. 245 Vol. 1 Prop. 35 Obs. 2

### Preservation of the race, restoration of Jews, city specially honored
It must embrace:
1. The *preservation* of the race
2. The *restoration* of the Jews
3. The *city* specially honored
p. 245 Vol. 1 Prop 35 Obs. 3
### Gross violation
>Obs. 4. The Prophets describing one Kingdom, here on the earth, at some time in the future under the Messiah, and associated with the Jewish nation and the Davidic throne, it is a gross violation of all propriety to take these prophetic descriptions and arbitrarily apply them, as many do, by dividing them—one part to the earth, another to the third heaven; one portion to the present time, and another to the distant future.
### Importance of proper comparison and union of prophecy
>In the doctrine of the Kingdom we make much of the proper comparison and union of Prophecy, and especially lay stress on the sameness of language, ideas, etc., existing between Isaiah and the Apocalypse (as e.g. comp. Isa. 60 with Rev., chs. 21 and 22.).
>p. 246 Vol. 1 Prop. 35 Obs. 5
### Foreknown
>Obs. 6. Even in David’s and Solomon’s time this Kingdom was, in view of the foreseen rebellion of the nation, predicted as a future restored one under one of David’s descendants; and this was based on the peculiar covenanted relationship of the nation and then existing Davidic dynasty, as e.g. Ps. 89:20-52, Ps. 132:11-18, etc.
>. . . to show us convincingly that God *foreknew* the defection of the nation, and in His Plan provided for it.
>p. 247 Vol. 1 Prop. 35 Obs. 6
