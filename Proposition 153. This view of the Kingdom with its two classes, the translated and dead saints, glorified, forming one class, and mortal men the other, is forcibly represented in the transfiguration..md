# Proposition 153. This view of the Kingdom with its two classes (viz., the translated and dead saints, glorified, forming one class and mortal men the other) is forcibly represented in the transfiguration.

### Props Mentioned
50 81 83 86 114 118 124 130 138 184 205
### A representation of the Kingdom in some of its aspects
>The transfiguration is thus regarded *as a type of the Saviour’s future glory in His Kingdom*.
>p. 555 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 1

>... the confession had been made by Peter that Jesus was “*The Christ* of God” (Luke 9:20); “*The Christ*” (Mark 9:29); “*The Christ*, the Son of the living God” (Matt. 16:16). In these words are contained not only a reference to His Messiahship as the promised King, but (as in Matthew) to the Theocratic (Divine) relationship that this ruler as the Anointed One sustained. (Comp. Prop. 205). It is God again condescending to act as *Theocratic ruler* in the person of this Jesus. The phraseology denotes the *Theocratic Rulership* as associated with the restored throne and Kingdom of David.
>p. 557 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 2

>... the term “*Christ*” was an equivalent to the phrase “*King of the Jews*” as seen in the significant superscription of the cross, and in Herod, the Priests, and Scribes making “*the King of the Jews*” in the question of the wise men identical with that of “*Christ*".
>p. 557 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 2

>But denoting as it does that Jesus is *the Theocratic King*, the appointed One to rule over the Jewish nation both as David’s heir and God’s Son (God thus ruling in and through Him), we see a reason why He should not, at that time, be proclaimed “*The Christ*,” viz., that this would be in effect announcing Him as “*the King of the Jews*” which, in view of His rejection, the postponement of the reign, the contemplated sacrifice, the unnecessary collision, charges, accusations, etc., that would be evolved, it was not prudent or advisable to adopt.
>p. 557 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 2
### Transfiguration really occurred
>Obs. 3. The transfiguration itself is *a real* occurrence, as the entire narration fully demonstrates.
>p. 558 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 3
### The glory of Christ in the presence of his saints
>The transfiguration, following the announcement that “some” should, before their death, see “the Son of man Coming in His Kingdom,” is *a representation of the Kingdom* in some of its aspects, viz., *in the glory of* “*the Christ*” *or King, in the presence of* (who also “appeared in glory,” Luke 9:31) *the translated and dead saints, and in the witnessing of that glory by mortal men*. It was a temporary display, an outward manifestation or revealing of the majesty and glory *that belongs* to Jesus when He comes *at the Second Advent in His Kingdom* with His saints to reign over the nations.
>p. 559-560 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 4

#### Moses represents resurrected saints
#### Elijah represents translated saints

>Moses represents the body of saints who have died, but who will also be glorified with Christ; and as he was in converse with the glorified Saviour, so will they also be in nearness to Him. Moses and Elias both appearing “in glory,” seems to indicate the same glorification of body. Elias represents another body, who, like himself, shall not fall “asleep,” but shall be translated without experiencing the power of death. These two, the dead and the living, who shall be glorified at the Coming of Jesus, are graphically portrayed in 1 Cor. 15:51, 52, and 1 Thess. 4:15-17. These not only *see* His glory, but *partake* of the same, 1 Jno. 3:2; Phil. 3:21, etc., for of them it is said: “*When Christ*” (notice, as “Christ”), “*who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory*, Col. 3:4.
>p. 560 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 4

#### Peter, James, John represent unglorified, mortal men

>But in addition to these, we have, to meet the prophetic announcements and to fill out the representation, *three persons*, Peter, James, and John, *unglorified, mortal men living on the earth*, who see this glorified Christ and His glorified associates, and are so deeply impressed, so delighted with *the exceeding glory* revealed, that through the spokesman Peter, the emphatic declaration is made: “*Lord, it is good for us to be here*.”
>p. 560-561 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 4

### Disputed Passage - Matt. 10:23
Obs. 5
>Under the influence of the Church-Kingdom theory, this Scripture has received the most varied interpretations.
>p. 563 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 5

>There are only two interpretations which reconcile, fully, this passage with the I peculiar phraseology contained in it, and, especially, without doing violence to the implied *personal* Coming.
>p. 564 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 5

>... the Son of man alludes to His triumphal entry into Jerusalem,...
>p. 564 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 5

>... the transfiguration, which also occurred *after this saying*, is in all respects a fulfilment of the passage—the Coming of the Son of man in His personal appearance being accurately represented by the transaction as we have just delineated.
>p. 564 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 5

### Elijah
>Obs. 6. Before concluding, it is well to contemplate an additional circumstance, which conclusively shows that the transfiguration was both *a reality and a representation* of the future Advent.
>p. 565 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 6

>The more modern notion that John was in all respects the Elias predicted in Mal. 4:5, and that no other need to be expected from the language of the Saviour here, was unknown to the early (Brookes, *El. of Proph. Interp.*, p. 90, says “down to Jerome”), Church.
>p. 565 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 6

>... others, make Elias still future, an idea being developed that he would be a contemporary of the Antichrist at the last times. So deeply rooted was this opinion, derived from the primitive Church, that even Augustine (*City of God*, B. 20, ch. 28) advocates the personal Coming of Elias and the conversion of the Jews before the Advent of Christ to judgment.
>p. 565-566 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 6

>Whereas, in fact, *two* oppressing BabyIons were foretold, and *two* returns from captivity, *two* Advents of Elias, and *two* Advents of Messiah, and yet but *one* Kingdom.” (Jones’s *Notes on Scripture*, foot-note, p. 179.) The rejection of the Kingdom and its postponement serves to explain the apparent difficulties and adds most forcibly to the inspiration of the Word, evincing a preservation of unity in the most delicate of Divine purposes.
>p. 566 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 6

### Tabernacle and Temple are types
Obs. 7
>... the Tabernacle was Theocratically associated, and therefore relates to the Theocratic ordering.
>p. 568 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 7

>If at all typical of the future Theocratic ordering, it certainly refers to the threefold nearness to the King as exemplified in the glorified kings and priests who are associated with Him, in the Jewish nation which is His special inheritance, and in the Gentiles who joyfully acknowledge this Theocratic supremacy.
>p. 568 Vol. 2 Prop. 153 Obs. 7
