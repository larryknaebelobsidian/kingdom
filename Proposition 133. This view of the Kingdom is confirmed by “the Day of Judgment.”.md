>If the monkish view of the day of judgment, now so prevalent even among Protestants, is correct, *then* it follows that, it being deemed the period of the winding up, or ending, of all sublunary things, no place can be found for such a Kingdom after it. But, on the other hand, if *it can be conclusively shown* that this day of judgment is connected with, enters into, and follows through the Millennial era, *then* it materially aids in supporting our view of the Covenanted Kingdom. That it does this is already evidenced by preceding Propositions, but the Spirit affords us in the Word additional reasons to sustain our belief.
>p. 362 Vol. 2 Prop. 133

Acts 17:31
because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He determined, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from the dead.

Rom. 2:16
on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.

1 Thess. 5:2
For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.

1 Cor. 1:8
who will also confirm you to the end, beyond reproach in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

2 Pet. 3:7-8
But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. 8 But do not let this one _fact_ escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.


### Zech 14 - Day

[Zechariah 14:1](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-001)

Behold, a **day** is coming for Yahweh when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.

[Zechariah 14:3](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-003)

Then Yahweh will go forth and fight against those nations, as the **day** when He fights on a **day** of battle.

[Zechariah 14:4](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-004)

And in that **day** His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.

[Zechariah 14:5](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-005)

And you will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; indeed, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the **days** of Uzziah king of Judah. Then Yahweh, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!

[Zechariah 14:6](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-006)

And it will be in that **day**, that there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.

[Zechariah 14:7](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-007)

And it will be a unique **day** which is known to Yahweh, neither **day** nor night, but it will be that at evening time there will be light.

[Zechariah 14:8](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-008)

And it will be in that **day**, that living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter.

[Zechariah 14:9](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-009)

And Yahweh will be king over all the earth; in that **day** Yahweh will be the only one, and His name one.

[Zechariah 14:13](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-013)

And it will be in that **day**, that abundant confusion from Yahweh will fall on them; and they will take hold of one another’s hand, and the hand of one will go up against the hand of another.

[Zechariah 14:20](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-020)

In that **day** there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, “Holy to Yahweh.” And the pots in the house of Yahweh will be like the bowls before the altar.

[Zechariah 14:21](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-021)

And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Yahweh of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of Yahweh of hosts in that **day**.

>The announcement comes to us in the simplest form, that a period of time is appointed in which Jesus will be revealed as the Judge, the King, assume the visible Judgeship or Rulership of the World, and the events connected therewith, such as the resurrection of the saints, the overthrow of enemies, the restoration of the Jewish nation, the subjugation of all people, the binding of Satan, the rewarding of the righteous, the fulfilment of Mill, predictions, etc., indicate a lengthy period.
