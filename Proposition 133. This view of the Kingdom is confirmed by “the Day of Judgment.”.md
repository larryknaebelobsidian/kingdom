>If the monkish view of the day of judgment, now so prevalent even among Protestants, is correct, *then* it follows that, it being deemed the period of the winding up, or ending, of all sublunary things, no place can be found for such a Kingdom after it. But, on the other hand, if *it can be conclusively shown* that this day of judgment is connected with, enters into, and follows through the Millennial era, *then* it materially aids in supporting our view of the Covenanted Kingdom. That it does this is already evidenced by preceding Propositions, but the Spirit affords us in the Word additional reasons to sustain our belief.
>p. 362 Vol. 2 Prop. 133

Acts 17:31
because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He determined, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from the dead.

Rom. 2:16
on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.

1 Thess. 5:2
For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.

1 Cor. 1:8
who will also confirm you to the end, beyond reproach in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

2 Pet. 3:7-8
But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. 8 But do not let this one _fact_ escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.
### Zech 14 - Day

[Zechariah 14:1](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-001)
Behold, a **day** is coming for Yahweh when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.

[Zechariah 14:3](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-003)
Then Yahweh will go forth and fight against those nations, as the **day** when He fights on a **day** of battle.

[Zechariah 14:4](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-004)
And in that **day** His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.

[Zechariah 14:5](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-005)
And you will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; indeed, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the **days** of Uzziah king of Judah. Then Yahweh, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!

[Zechariah 14:6](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-006)
And it will be in that **day**, that there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.

[Zechariah 14:7](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-007)
And it will be a unique **day** which is known to Yahweh, neither **day** nor night, but it will be that at evening time there will be light.

[Zechariah 14:8](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-008)
And it will be in that **day**, that living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter.

[Zechariah 14:9](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-009)
And Yahweh will be king over all the earth; in that **day** Yahweh will be the only one, and His name one.

[Zechariah 14:13](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-013)
And it will be in that **day**, that abundant confusion from Yahweh will fall on them; and they will take hold of one another’s hand, and the hand of one will go up against the hand of another.

[Zechariah 14:20](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-020)
In that **day** there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, “Holy to Yahweh.” And the pots in the house of Yahweh will be like the bowls before the altar.

[Zechariah 14:21](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Zechariah+14&h=38-014-021)
And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Yahweh of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of Yahweh of hosts in that **day**.
### Not all judgement is at the same time
>Obs. 1. Again the reader is reminded that the Jewish and Early Church doctrine of the Judgment Day is something *very different* from the Popish doctrine now so generally entertained. The notion of an assize, a universal gathering of dead and living, pious and wicked, before a tribunal at which character is to be tested, etc., was developed in the Church several centuries later, in the form *now* held by many writers. On all sides are to be found utterances concerning the judgment utterly unknown, and completely antagonistic to the doctrine *once held by the Church*.
>p. 362 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 1

>... the very fact of the resurrection of the saints, thus counted worthy of it, and the non-resurrection of the wicked at the time of the first resurrection, counted unworthy of it, proves to us *a pre-existing judgment*.
>p. 364 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 2

>... the question arises, Why subject these same parties—especially taking Brown’s, Barnes’s, etc. idea that the saints have been, many of them for centuries upon centuries, in the third heaven enjoying a development of glory indescribable, etc.—to be brought before a tribunal *to undergo a scrutiny* of character? This difficulty and others vanish only if we allow the legitimate meaning given to the original by commentators, which involves our idea, that the saints are manifested before that throne to be assigned their position *as rulers* in the Kingdom, which apportionment is *only done* at the manifestation of the Kingdom itself, and is proportioned to the deeds done in the body.
>...
>All are raised from the dead, but each in his own order; so also all shall stand before His throne, but each in his order.
>p. 364 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 2

>Obs. 3. The Judgment Day is inseparably linked with *the personal presence* of the Judge, and therefore, as we proceed, it is unnecessary to repeat what all admit. It is very essential to our doctrine to find the judgment united with the Coming of the Son of Man. 
>p. 364 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 3

>Mede (Works, B. 3, p. 762) long ago observed that Dan. 7 contains “*The mother text of Scripture, whence the Jews grounded the name and expectation of the Great Day of Judgment*.”
>p. 364 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 3

>The facts (1) that the phrases *originated* with Jewish believers, and (2) that they are employed without the least intimation that they are to be understood *differently*, certainly ought to have *some weight* with the student.
>p. 365 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 3
### A day
>Obs. 4. The Judgment Day is designated, Acts 17:31, “*He hath appointed a day wherein He will judge the world in righteousness*,” etc.
>p. 365 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 4

>It is called “*a day*,” which in the largeness of prophecy does not indicate an ordinary day, or even a brief period of time, but may include a *long, extended time*.
>p. 365 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 4

>The word is employed to denote time *indefinitely*, as “the day of trouble,” “the day of adversity,” “the day of prosperity,” etc. Again, it is used to designate *definite periods*, either short or long, as e.g. the *six* days of creation are called “day” Gen. 2:4; the *forty* years in the wilderness are named, Heb. 3:8; Ps. 95:8, “the day of temptation;” the *times* of the Messiah are called by the prophets “that day,” “the day of the Lord,” as Isa. 24:25, 26; Zech. 14, etc.; “the day of salvation, 2 Cor. 6:2,“the day,” Heb. 3:7, 13; Ps. 118:24, etc., are admitted to embrace *an entire dispensation*. It is well known that prophecy speaks of events occurring “in that day,” which the fulfilment snows occupied *hundreds of years* in fulfilling. Reference might be made to other passages, such as John 8:56; 1 Cor. 5:5; Deut. 33:12, etc., all showing this usage by the Spirit.
>p. 365-366 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 4
### 'Last Judgment' term is not in the New Test.
>Obs. 5. The scholastic or eccles. terms “*the Last Judgment*,” Dr. Knapp (*Ch. Theol.*, p. 542) frankly says is not employed in the New Test., and that the phrases “the last day” or “last days” are not “used exclusively with reference *to the end of the world*.
>p. 367 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 5
### Long period of time
>Obs. 6. Peter certainly knew the Jewish view of the Messiah’s Judgeship, the Day of Judgment, etc., and yet he in the plainest possible manner *confirms* the truthfulness of it. In 2 Pet. 3:7, 8 he introduces the Coming of the Saviour and the reservation of the heavens and earth unto fire "*against the Day of Judgment* and the perdition of ungodly men,” and then adds: “But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that *one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day*.” Having just mentioned “the *Day* of Judgment,” he guards the expression by the words following, lest it should be limited to a short period, or even to a literal day. Foreseeing, by the Spirit, this very error into which multitudes have fallen, he cautions us that this “*day*” of which he writes, may include, at least, *a thousand years*.
>p. 367 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 6

>“the Day of Judgment” simply denotes -*a time* of judgment, and embraces within its limits the Millennium, *a long period of time*.
>p. 368 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 6
### Judgeship is part of rulership
>Our faith accepts of the simple fact that the government in this Coming Kingdom of King Jesus and His saints, which is to subject all to the predicted Theocratic rule and dominion, is designated as “*the judgment*,” and the period of its exercise is called “*the day*” the time, etc.
>p. 370 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 7

>The announcement comes to us in the simplest form, that *a period of time is appointed* in which Jesus will be revealed as the Judge, the King, assume the visible Judgeship or Rulership of the World, and the events connected therewith, such as the resurrection of the saints, the overthrow of enemies, the restoration of the Jewish nation, the subjugation of all people, the binding of Satan, the rewarding of the righteous, the fulfilment of Mill, predictions, etc., indicate *a lengthy period*.
>p. 370 Vol. 2 Prop. 133 Obs. 7
