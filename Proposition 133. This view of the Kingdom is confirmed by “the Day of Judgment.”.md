>If the monkish view of the day of judgment, now so prevalent even among Protestants, is correct, then it follows that, it being deemed the period of the winding up, or ending, of all sublunary things, no place can be found for such a Kingdom after it. But, on the other hand, if it can be conclusively shown that this day of judgment is connected with, enters into, and follows through the Millennial era, then it materially aids in supporting our view of the Covenanted Kingdom. That it does this is already evidenced by preceding Propositions, but the Spirit affords us in the Word additional reasons to sustain our belief.
