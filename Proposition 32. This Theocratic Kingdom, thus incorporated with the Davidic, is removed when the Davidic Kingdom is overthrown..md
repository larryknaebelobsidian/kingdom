# Proposition 32. This Theocratic Kingdom, thus incorporated with the Davidic, is removed when the Davidic Kingdom is overthrown.

### Props Mentioned
None
### Supporting Evidence
>Obs. 1. The Proposition is evidenced, 
>(1) by the continued overthrow of what God called His throne and Kingdom (Ezek. 21:25-27, Hos. 3:4, 5, etc.); 
>(2) by the Prophets not recognizing any other Theocratic Kingdom than the one thus connected; 
>(3) by the restoration from Babylon, building of the temple, etc., being never likened to this Kingdom, for although blessings were vouchsafed to the nation from God through His general divine Sovereignty, yet God did *not act* as their King, which is seen, e.g. in the Jews being still “servants” and others had “dominion over them” (Neh. 9:36, 37), being placed under tribute, (Ezra 4:13 and 7:24); 
>(4) by the simple fact that neither in the temple rebuilt nor in any subsequent political position of the Jews, was God directly accessible as Ruler, to be consulted, etc.; 
>(5) by the Jews themselves, in their future political and religious status, never supposing, after the overthrow of the Davidic Kingdom, that it or the Theocracy connected with it was restored, but constantly and ardently looked for its re-establishment; 
>(6) by the withdrawal of God, more and more decided, so that even for centuries the voice of prophecy was silent. 
>In brief, all the circumstances indicated, that the distinctive features which manifested a Theocracy, were withdrawn, and the religious, the ceremonial, indispensably necessary for the moral preparation and culture of man, was alone continued. The nation was undergoing divine punishment for its *non-appreciation of Theocratic privileges*.

### Maccabean princes did not restore the full Theocracy
>Obs. 2. The highest position, politically, occupied by the nation afterward under the brilliant reign of the Maccabean Princes, was never regarded as a return to the Davidic or Theocratic rule. The Asmoneans were not in the Davidic line, and God was not the Theocratic King as once before.

### Second temple did not restore the full Theocracy
>Obs. 3. The highest religious position afterward arrived at, when the Temple was restored with magnificence, did not meet the Theocratic features. The second Temple, among other deficiencies, possessed not the manifestation of the Divine Presence of the great King in the Holy of Holies, and gave not forth, as the first Temple, the responses of an earthly Ruler. With all the veneration attached to it by the Jews, they never regarded its and their worship there, as the enjoyment of *a restored* Theocratic government. They still lamented *the loss* of the once enjoyed precious boon.

### Jewish history (due to Kingdom) is focus of the Bible
>Obs. 4. The reader, although perhaps premature in our line of argument, will notice that this feature has its decided influence in shaping the peculiar and striking manner in which the Bible is written and placed together.
>...
>The mighty empires of the world are as nothing to God when compared to His initiatory Theocratic ordering.
>...
>in the estimation of Deity, there was in this nucleus, this earnest of government, something that *outweighed* the grandeur of all earthly Kingdoms. *This was the Theocracy*. God shows *due respect* to His own ordering, and hence confines Himself *almost* exclusively to the history of the Jewish nation. Other Kingdoms are, indeed, mentioned, but only to show their relationship to the Jewish nation and to pronounce their doom, or the final result when the Theocracy shall be triumphantly reestablished. This gives the Bible its remarkable cast of expression and its historical connection.
