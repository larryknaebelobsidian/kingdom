the Second Adam or Man, of the dominion lost by the First Adam or

Father. <br />
Proposition 84. As this Kingdom is specially given to the Son of Man as
the result of his obedience, sufferings, and death, it must be something
different Proposition 85. Neither Abraham, nor his engrafted seed have
as yet inherited the Kingdom hence the Kingdom must be something
different from “piety,” “religion” and “God’s reign in the
heart.” <br />
Proposition 86. The object or design of this dispensation is to gather
out these elects to whom, as heirs with Abraham and his seed, Christ,
this Kingdom is to be given. <br />
