# Notes on The Theocratic Kingdom

These are notes (***ALMOST ALL DIRECT QUOTATIONS***) on George N. H. Peters' great work "The Theocratic Kingdom" taken by Larry Knaebel.  A few personal notes are included. 

Peters' work contains 206 propositions (i.e. chapters). Each proposition contains a set of observations.  Pericopes were added by me to **most** of the observations.
