# Notes taken on The Theocratic Kingdom

These are notes (***ALMOST ALL DIRECT QUOTATIONS***) on George N. H. Peters great work "The Theocratic Kingdom" taken by Larry Knaebel.  A few personal notes are included. Peters work contains 206 propositions (i.e. chapters). Each proposition contains a set of observations.  Pericopes were added by me to **most** of the observations to attempt to aid me in the consumption of the vast amount of material Peters presents in his work. A perusal of the electronic table of contents (pdf reader or EPUB reader) allows one to review the content of each proposition.
