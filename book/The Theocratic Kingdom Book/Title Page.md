# Selected Quotations from "The Theocratic Kingdom"

It has been a pleasure spending my first full year of retirement taking a journey with George N. H. Peters to discover the wonders of the kingdom of heaven.  He continuously points his readers to the King of this kingdom, the God who purposed it, the Scriptures by which God reveals it, the long history of those who believe it as revealed and of those who do not.

I was briefly introduced to this work while taking a Bible class many years ago but was recently reminded of it while doing some other reading.  

**The Theocratic Kingdom** contains 206 propositions (i.e. chapters) and each proposition contains a set of observations (i.e. sections).  The proposition titles themselves are masterfully stated and organized to deal with this major biblical topic and are worthy of memorization (although I have not).

These are my selected quotations of George N. H. Peters' great work "The Theocratic Kingdom" .  Although I have inserted a very few personal notes and added pericopes to **most** of the observations  (this is still a work in progress) these are mainly quotations from Peters' three volume masterful work.
