Isa. 25:6-8
And Yahweh of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain;
A banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow,
_And_ refined, aged wine.
7 And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples,
Even the veil which is stretched over all nations.
8 He will swallow up death for all time,
And Lord Yahweh will wipe tears away from all faces,
And He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth;
For Yahweh has spoken.

Hosea 13:14
Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol?
Shall I redeem them from death?
O Death, where are your thorns?
O Sheol, where is your sting?
Compassion will be hidden from My sight.

Daniel 12:2
And many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to reproach _and_ everlasting contempt.

>The language then expresses *a literal, partial resurrection*. Now in its connection it describes a Pre-Millennial one, briefly, for the following reasons: 
>	(1) It is placed at the end of certain prophetic periods, which, as nearly all commentators agree, precede, or run down to, the commencement of the Millennial period; 
>	(2) it is connected with a deliverance of the people of God, pre-eminently characteristic of the beginning of the Millennial era; 
>	(3) it is identified with a period of great trouble, distress, etc., which, as many prophecies declare, precedes the ushering in of that age; 
>	(4) it is related to the period when the wicked shall be rooted out, etc., which is descriptive of the commencement of this age; 
>	(5) and the identifying of the promise annexed by Jesus Himself to the time immediately after the harvest, “then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun,” for, as Joel and John show, the harvest immediately precedes the Millennial glory.

Daniel 12:13
But as for you, go _your way_ to the end; then you will enter into rest and stand _again_ for your allotted portion at the end of the days.

>No other interpretation, therefore, can be affixed to this, than that it implies the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, and that the mind of Daniel was directed onward to that.
>p. 248 Vol 2 Prop. 126 Obs. 3

Ezek. 37:1-14 - Valley of Dry Bones
Isa. 26:19

>in the Scriptures a moral change of the soul is uniformly held to be a *prelude* to a blessed resurrection of the body unto life
>p. 250 Vol 2 Prop. 126 Obs. 4

>the language of Jesus addressed to Jews is a confirmation of a literal resurrection. (John 5:28,29)
>p. 251 Vol 2 Prop. 126 Obs. 4

>The covenant, if Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are *to personally inherit* the land, the covenant promises, if the meek are to *inherit* the land, etc., absolutely *demands* just such bringing of the dead ones *into* the land of Israel, *the promised inheritance*.
>p. 251 Vol 2 Prop. 126 Obs. 4

>For the word translated "*regeneration*" means "*born again*", and was anciently employed to denote the resurrection.
>p. 257 Vol 2 Prop. 126 Obs. 6

>This doctrine of a literal Pre-Millennial resurrection we admit, is* *Jewish*.” This term of reproach (given in this sense by man) we cheerfully accept, for it is a distinguishing feature of our faith, seeing that we find it in the covenant given *to Jews*, in *Jewish* Prophets, in the teaching of a *Jewish* Saviour and *Jewish* apostles, and in agreement with *Jewish* statements of doctrine; and that only such who are engrafted into the Abrahamic stock and become members of the *Jewish* commonwealth, shall participate in it. It belongs pre-eminently to the introduction of that Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom promised to the *Jewish* select nation. Even Rabbinical lore is full of intimations intimations respecting it. That, therefore, which forms such an objectionable feature to many, is only *an additional reason* for retaining it. (Comp. e.g. Prop. 68.)

>the Rabbins (Tract Sanhedrin, 2) as quoting such passages as Deut. 31:16, and 1:8 in favor of a resurrection.
>p. 261 Vol 2 Prop. 126 Obs. 7 note

>One reason, apparently, why the resurrection is more prominently given by Daniel, Ezekiel, and others is the following: The resurrection is allied with a *restored* Theocracy
>p. 261 Vol 2 Prop. 126 Obs. 7 note

>This Pre-Millennial restoration aids in solving a difficulty (unnecessarily such) felt by theologians, viz., that the first books of the Bible are only confined to temporal, earthly blessings, or rather, as it should be worded to be correct, blessings here on earth. The question deduced is: Why is the hope constantly held up to the Jews of living in their promised land and none presented of rewards in the third heaven? The substance of the answer given by those who reject *the key* afforded by the Covenant and this resurrection, is this: that the Jews were not then prepared for other promises, and that the real hope and destiny was to be gradually revealed as they could bear it, etc. Learned dissertations are tilled with just such nonsense, or “worldly wisdom.” Such reasoning places both man and God in a false position. The former, as if he were then so intellectually and morally *weak* as to be *disqualified* to appreciate his own destination, and *now*, even in the case of heathen or all men, *so strong* as to be able to bear such knowledge; the latter, as if He would conceal *the true destination* of those who trusted in Him and excite their hopes, etc., by either *false* or *temporary* motives. No! never does God thus deal with man. The true reason, and the one underlying the Covenant and all these promises, is. that *the land, the earth*, is truly—*as always affirmed*—their inheritance, and that God will raise them up out of their graves and fulfil the promises given by bringing them *into the land*; and, moreover, God *never changes* from this divine purpose, for the promise (Prop. 142) exists to-day, as it ever did, “*Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit*” (not the third heaven but), “*the earth*.” The language of Moses and others is *the best* that could be used, for it is *the truth*—the truth of God which *in His own time* He will see is realized. We are not to come to God’s Word and gauge it by *a monkish* third heaven theory, which makes the third heaven the saint’s inheritance instead of *the one* that God uniformly *through every prophet* has promised, and then by it judge of the propriety and truthfulness of the Divine utterances. Would that Abrahamic faith were *more characteristic* of believers! (comp. Props. 144, 151, etc.).
