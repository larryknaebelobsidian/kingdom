>Notice: 
>(1) the Abrahamic covenant out of which arises the Kingdom; 
>(2) the Theocracy in its initiatory form; 
>(3) the change by incorporating the Davidic line through which it was to be exerted; 
>(4) the overthrow of this Kingdom; 
>(5) the prophecies and preaching touching its restoration under David’s Son; 
>(6) the distinguishing peculiarities of this Son; 
>(7) the postponement of this Kingdom, and the reasons assigned for the same; 
>(8) the unity of expression in reference to the time of its re-establishment, viz., at the Sec. Advent; 
>(9) the work that is to be performed during this period of postponement; 
>(10) the condition of the Jewish nation during this time; 
>(11) the ultimate restoration of the Kingdom as given by covenant, prophets and apostles in perfect agreement. 
>These are some of the salient points presented, and, judging from the history of human nature as presented outside of the Bible, it is *incredible* to believe that such a statement of Divine Purpose could be given by men widely separated in time with human prejudices, weaknesses, etc., without contradictions *unless divinely guided*.
>p. 467-468 Vol. 3 Prop. 198 Obs. 1 slightly reformatted

>To illustrate our meaning: unless the Kingdom itself is part of the Divine Plan, *how* could Moses predict its temporary overthrow, the calling of the Gentiles, and its subsequent restoration? *How* could the prophets after its downfall predict its long continuance in such a condition, the period of Gentile domination, the gathering out of a people, the restitution at the Coming of the Messiah (not in humiliation but) in glory? *How* could Jesus proclaim its postponement and direct us as proof to a constantly abiding historical fact, that of the treading down of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the nation? *How* could Jesus, against the most stubborn prejudice and national pride, preach the fall of the nation, the grafting in of Gentiles, and the delayment of the Kingdom to the Sec. Advent”? These are a few, out of a multitude of similar questions, that *must first* be answered before inspiration is denied.
>p. 468 Vol. 3 Prop. 198 Obs. 1

>The Kingdom, its past, present, or future state, forms *the key-note* of Revelation, and in no instance do we find the writers involving themselves in expressions relating to it that are *antagonistic* to each other.
>p. 468 Vol. 3 Prop. 198 Obs. 1

>Unless it can be shown that such a consecutive plan, in itself opposed to the wishes, etc., of the nation, would be suggested by reason, or is a natural result flowing from the powers of man, it is the most reasonable to accept of the only explanation which thus far alone covers the ground, viz., that of inspiration.
