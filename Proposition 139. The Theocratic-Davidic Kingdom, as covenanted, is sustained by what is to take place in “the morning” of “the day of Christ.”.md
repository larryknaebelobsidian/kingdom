>We now come to one of those beautiful, most forcible evidences of the truthfulness of our position, which *no other theory* can present. For, the Divine Spirit, taking *part* of the phrase “the day of the Lord,” etc., viz., *the morning* or introductory of that day, allies with it such events, identified fully with the Millennial era, that the student can be at *no loss* to distinguish and locate the period of time intended. “*The morning*” is so widely different in blessing, judgment, etc., from the beginning of this present dispensation, that *no comparison* can be instituted between them. The fact, too, that this figure of “*the morning*?’ is employed by writers separated by ages; that they coincide in attributing to it the same results; that they preserve a wonderful unity in the use of it, establishes us the *more firmly* in a doctrine universally received by the Early Church.

>The Millennial day is introduced by the personal coming of Jesus. To perfect this figure of “*the morning*,” if it alludes to the beginning of the same period of time, it would be highly appropriate, if thus dependent on Christ’s Coming, to designate Him either as *the Morning Star* or as *the Sun* ushering in this day. This also is done to prove to us, if we will but accept of it, that this coming is *the real, veritable coming of the person* called “*the Star*” and “*the Sun*,” who shines forth, not through others, but, in His own proper effulgence. It is therefore *with pleasure* that we read in “the last words of David,” that (2 Sam. 23:1-4) “there shall be a Just One ruling over men, ruling in the fear of God; *as the light of the morning shall He arise, the Sun of an unclouded morning*, shining after rain upon the tender grass of the earth.” Night disappears when the sun comes, so this “night” shall fade away when “the Sun of an unclouded morning” arises, ushering in *a glorious day*. Hence Jesus is styled also “*the bright and morning star*,” “*the Day Star*,” because His coming shall be the sure sign of *the dawning* of the foretold morning. He is not merely called such owing to the glory of His person or the splendor of His appearing, but because He reveals Himself *in the early morning*. For, Hos. 6:3,“*His going forth is prepared as the morning*”

>The events associated with this morning are of such a nature that they can only be realized *after* the Second Advent; and they thus confirm the Pre-Mill. Advent, the reign of the Just One in the day *following* this morning, etc. 
>1. *The resurrection* and *the dominion* of the saints is connected with this morning Thus in Ps. 49:14, 15, the Psalmist contrasts the condition of the wicked and righteous: “*Like sheep they* (the wicked) *are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them* IN THE MORNING; *and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave; for He shall receive me*.” Here the prophet distinguishes between those who rise in the morning (1st res.) and have dominion, and the rest of the dead who lived not again until the one thousand years were finished. In Ps. 88:10-15, after alluding to death and the grave whither he was tending, the Psalmist asks, “*Wilt Thou show wonders to the dead? Shall the dead arise and praise Thee*?” etc., and then expresses his hope of a resurrection: “*But unto Thee have I cried, O Lord; and* IN THE MORNING *shall my prayer prevent Thee*.” The same is found in Ps. 143:8, where death is described as smiting the righteous one and making him to dwell in darkness, and the prayer, inspired by the Spirit, comes forth impressively: “*Cause me to hear Thy lovingkindness* IN THE MORNING, *for in Thee do I trust*,” etc. The expression found in several Ps., “*I will awake early*,” can only be satisfactorily explained of his awaking (res.) in this morning. In Ps. 90, after alluding to the universality of death, etc., the petition is offered: “*Return, O Lord, how long? and let it repent Thee concerning Thy servants*” (that is, do not let them thus be subject to the power of death); “*O satisfy us early* (lit. as some critics: *in the morning*), *with Thy mercy, that we may be glad and rejoice all our days*.” If we are to take the rendering given by the Vulgate, Syriac, Chaldee, and by some critics, of the phrase, Eng. Version of Isa. 26:19: “*for Thy dew is as the dew of herbs*,” which is presented as “*the dew of the dawn*,” then in immediate connection with the resurrection there is reference to the morning. Delitzsch, sustained by Alexander on Isa. and others, translates Isa. 8:19, 20, “*they are a people for whom* NO MORNING DAWNS,” which the marg. reading, “Heb. *no morning*,” also affirms; thus corroborating that the wicked, living or dead, have *no part or lot* in this morning. 
>2. The utter *destruction and removal* of the wicked is identified with this incoming morning. This we have seen is predicated also of the introduction of the Mill. age. Thus Isa. 17:14, speaking of the nations who set themselves against God (as in the last confederation, Rev. 19, etc.), adds: “*Behold* AT EVENING TIDE *trouble; and* BEFORE THE MORNING *he is not. This is the portion of those that spoil us* (compare Zech. 14), *and the lot of them that rob us*.” In Mai. 4 the wicked are consumed and utterly rooted out at the time “*the Sun of Righteousness*” arises. In Ps. 59:16, after describing the confederation and overthrow of the wicked by the power of God, foreseeing the time of its accomplishment, the prophet bursts forth exultingly: “*But I will sing of Thy power, yea, I will sing aloud of Thy mercy* IN THE MORNING,” etc. If we take even Origen’s (Ag. Celsus) rendering of the word “early” in Ps. 101:8 which he makes “*morning*,” we have affirmed the destruction of the wicked of the land that they may be cut off from the city of the Lord. 
>3. It is, as the Mill, descriptions predict, a time of *deliverance and salvation*. Thus in Ps. 46:5, after portraying the mighty confederation under the figure of the roaring waters and the swelling sea, and then continuing the figure drawn from the waters and representing the incoming river or Kingdom so gladsome, the Psalmist assigns both the reason and the time when this confederation shall be overthrown and His Kingdom shall be established to the joy of His people: “*God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her, and that* RIGHT EARLY, or as marg. reading, Heb. “WHEN THE MORNING APPEARETH.” If it is allowable to receive the translation of Zeph. 3:5 given by Gildas (a.d. 546), there would be a distinct reference to this morning, as follows: “Our Lord is upright in the midst of His people, and *in the morning* He will not do injustice, *in the morning* He will give His judgment.” Job even (7:21) expresses the idea that deliverance shall be granted by God “in the morning” to those whom He, “the preserver of men,” has pardoned. 
>4. This morning is identified with *the rule* of Christ, and *the glorification* of the saints. This we have already seen, but the Spirit gives us additional evidence. Thus in Ps. 110: 2, 3, at the very time that “*the Lord shall send the rod of His strength out of Zion and shall rule in the midst of His enemies*,” then, “*Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauty of holiness from the womb of* THE MORNING” (alluding to “the birth,” etc.); “*Thou hast the dew of thy youth*” (referring to the renewal). If considered in the light of the general tenor of the Word, this passage is exceedingly expressive and beautiful. 
>5. Having shown and advocated as a necessary condition *the restoration* of the Jewish nation, a confirmation is found in the specification that this also (as we contended) takes place *in this morning*. Turning to Hos. 5:14, 15, and 6:3, when the Jewish restoration is spoken of in verse 15 (see McNeile, Lec. 4, *Prospects of the Jews*), it is said: “*in their affliction they will seek me* IN THE MORNING;” and in the next chapter, verse 3, the Lord’s return or coming is likened to “*the morning*.”
