# Proposition 34. The Prophets describe this restored Kingdom, its extension, glory, etc. without distinguishing between the First and Second Advents.

### Props Mentioned
55-57

>This peculiar feature has often been noticed by writers; and attention is called to it in this connection, because it is *of great moment* to understand this distinctive, significant method of prophecy.
>p. 242 Vol. 1 Prop. 34
### Main reason - offer of kingdom to the nation at first advent, rejection, postponement till second advent
>Obs. 1. Learned men, feeling the force of this uniformity, have supposed, correctly, that some good reason produced it, and to assign one, tell us how prophetic vision glances from the lower to the higher hills, passing over the intermediate valleys, etc., thus presenting a beautiful and glowing picture of ecstatic vision. While there is truth in this description, it utterly fails to assign *any reason* for it, only presenting *the manner* in which it is done. The leading motive for such a non-discrimination of First and Second Advent will be found in *the offer* of this same Kingdom to the Jewish nation at the First Advent (comp. Props. 55-57, etc.), and, upon its rejection by the nation, in its postponement to the Sec. Advent.
>p. 242 Vol. 1 Prop. 34 Obs. 1

### Offer, rejection and postponement were all foreknown 
>... it *conditioned* the necessity of only speaking *of the Advent*, without directly specifying a First or a Second.
>p. 242 Vol. 1 Prop. 34 Obs. 1
### Why purposely done?
>This intermingling and blending of Advents, or rather, this non-discrimination of Advents, is purposely done, 
>(1) to allow full latitude to the freedom of the nation; 
>(2) to evince the foreknowledge, truthfulness, and faithfulness of God; 
>(3) to test the faith of His people; 
>(4) to throw the responsibility of Christ’s rejection upon the nation; 
>(5) to prepare the way for the engrafting of the Gentiles; 
>(6) to avoid the despondency, etc., that must arise, if the long intervening period of time were presented.
>p. 242 Vol. 1 Prop. 34 Obs. 1
### Must be careful to discriminate the Scriptures that belong to different dispensations
>Obs. 2. This peculiarity of the prophecies impresses the injunction given by numerous writers, viz.: to be careful in discriminating the Scriptures that belong to different dispensations, e.g. that which pertains to the First Advent and the time following, and that which relates to the Sec. Advent and the age following it.
>p. 242-243 Vol. 1 Prop. 34 Obs. 2
### We are able to see more clearly since we can look back
>Obs. 3. Living at this period, so long after the First Advent, we are the better prepared, owing to fulfilments, to discriminate between the Scriptures, and make a correct application of them. God’s sincerity in tendering the Kingdom to the Jewish nation is evidenced by the very manner in which the nation’s rejection of the Messiah at the First Advent is delineated; it is rather implied than directly taught, and in such a way, that while now we see the guilt of the nation unmistakably presented, yet before the fulfilment it was—to avoid interfering with freedom of choice— more or less a mystery. To us, it is a mystery fully revealed.
>p. 243 Vol. 1 Prop. 34 Obs. 3
### First Advent fulfillment shows how we might expect Second Advent fulfillment
>Obs. 4. The manner in which the prophecies were fulfilled at the First. Advent teaches us *how* we may expect the prophecies pertaining to the Second to be realized, viz.: in *the strict* grammatical sense contained in them.
>p. 243 Vol. 1 Prop. 34 Obs. 4
### The two advents are united to perfect redemption
>Obs. 5. Another reason why the Prophets simply announce the Advent without discriminating is, that both Advents are *really unnecessary* for perfected Redemption—the one, we can now see, is preparatory for the other.
>p. 243 Vol. 1 Prop. 34 Obs. 5
### New Testament revelations clarify
>“It is only by the facts and revelations of the New Test, that ancient prophecy has been found conclusively to require for its complete verification two disparate manifestations of the Godhead; the one in humiliation, the other in glory.”
>--Fairbarn (*On Proph.*, p. 183)
>p. 243 Vol. 1 Prop. 34 Obs. 5
### Divine plan unites two advents separated by a time of waiting
>Obs. 6. The Kingdom being rejected by the Jews at the First Advent, *an intercalary period* intervenes, and “the times of the Gentiles” are continued on to the Sec. Advent. This is the reason why in some of the prophecies, when direct reference is made to the First Advent, the intervening period to the Second is passed by, and attention is directed to the Second with its results, as e.g. Ps. 69, Isa. 53 connected with ch. 54, etc. The Divine Plan thus *unites* the two as incorporated with it, and teaches *how*, in the light of God’s Word, this intercalary period ought to be regarded, so far as God’s Purpose is concerned—i.e. while exceeding precious to us who believe and who are adopted as the seed of Abraham, yet it is still a time of “*waiting*” and that it is, by no means, to be exalted into that disproportioned and exaggerated position that it holds in so many systems of Theology.
>p. 243-244 Vol. 1 Prop. 34 Obs. 6
### Kingdom is distinctly linked with Second Advent
>Obs. 7. The Kingdom is *nowhere* (although it is currently believed) directly asserted to be a resultant of the First Advent, but in the declarations of Christ and the apostles it is distinctly linked *with the Sec. Advent*, as e.g. Matt. 25:34, 2 Tim. 4:1, etc.
>p. 244 Vol. 1 Prop. 34 Obs. 7
### Shows highest wisdom and greatest strength
>Obs. 8. This characteristic of not distinguishing between the two Advents, excepting as the events connected with one or the other now (in view of fulfilment) enables us to discriminate between them, has been often ridiculed by Unbelief as an evidence of weakness. We, on the other hand, find in it *a profound meaning* and an indication of *the highest wisdom and the greatest strength*. Indeed, when properly comprehended in its true relationship to the Jewish nation and the Theocracy, it forms *a strong proof* of inspiration, being *a phase beyond human conception and continuance*.

>Divine Wisdom alone could devise such a wonderful way of predicting the future.
