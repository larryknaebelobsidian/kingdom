>In the first centuries Millenarianism was prevalent and generally held, Props. 72-76. It was entertained *in the form* that we now advocate, and, in the very nature of the case, *could not* receive the opinion stated in the Proposition. The Fathers all looked and longed for a speedy appearance of the Kingdom under the personal reign of Jesus. The opposers of Chiliasm in the third century first gave a different interpretation to the church, by which it was transformed into the Kingdom of Christ.

### Origen's novel view
>Obs. 1. The opposers mentioned designed such an exchange to offset the idea of a coming Kingdom of Christ here on earth. If they could point to an already existing Kingdom over which Christ then reigned as predicted, it would go far to demolish *the Chiliastic doctrine* of the future Kingdom. The Origenistic interpretation was admirably adapted to bring about so desirable a substitution, and through its flexible and mystical manipulations the work was accomplished. Origen was about, if not, the first one who introduced “the novelty.”

### Origen's undecided views
>Obs. 2. In justice, however, to Origen himself, we must add, that while paving the way for others, and expressing himself somewhat like many moderns, yet even he frequently writes guardedly, perhaps undecidedly. Thus e.g. in his “*De Principiis*” when making a Kingdom to exist here on earth in the church, he speaks of the church (B. 1, ch. 6) “*which is the form of that Kingdom which is to come*” and (in B. 3, ch. 6), he goes on to show that “*the form*” of a Kingdom does not include the reign of Christ, but only that of Christ’s agents, for speaking of “the consummation and restoration of all things” when “those better institutions” will be introduced, he adds: “For, *after* his Agents and servants, the Lord Christ, who is King of all, will *himself assume* the Kingdom.” As we cannot tell whether Rufinus added to this or not, we are content to receive it as also Origenistic, and proof that he himself could not entirely rid himself of *the early* church doctrine of a Kingdom still future belonging pre-eminently to Jesus Christ.

### Nominal Christianity
>Obs. 3. After the Roman Empire nominally became Christian, then, indeed, a host of writers sprang up, who lavished the Kingdom upon the church with so liberal a hand, that the union of state and church under Constantine and his successors was pronounced to be not only the Kingdom of Christ, but the Kingdom in Millennial bloom, even to a New Jerusalem condition. (See Eusebius and Jerome.)
### The withering touch of depravity
>Obs. 4. The history of the doctrine of the church should not influence any one to reject the truth itself. The Scriptures, in the cautions and warnings given, teach us to anticipate the result witnessed. No doctrine of the Bible, however important, but has been perverted and abused by men, and has been allied with error and even extravagance. The doctrine of the Kingdom has not escaped the withering touch of depravity;
### Infidel writers
>Obs. 5. With infidel writers no view of the church is satisfactory.
