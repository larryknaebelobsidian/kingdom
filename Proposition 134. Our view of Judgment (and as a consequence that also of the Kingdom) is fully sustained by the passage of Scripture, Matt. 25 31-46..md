### Matt. 25:31-46
>“But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. 32 And all the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; 33 and He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left. 34 “Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom, which has been prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 35 For I was hungry, and you gave Me _something_ to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me _something_ to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; 36 naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.’ 37 Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You _something_ to drink? 38 And when did we see You a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You? 39 And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ 40 And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, _even_ the least _of them_, you did it to Me.’ 41 “Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels; 42 for I was hungry, and you gave Me _nothing_ to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink; 43 I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me. 44 Then they themselves also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?’ 45 Then He will answer them, saying, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’ 46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”

>our doctrine firmly accepts of the truth that all men are to be judged, and that their eternal condition (saving that of the heathen) will depend on their acceptance or rejection of the commands of God in Christ (and their personal application), but we reassert that such a judgment is not necessarily simultaneous, for part of it is Pre-Millennial, part Millennial, and part Post-Millennial.
>Pre-Millennial, 
>as it affects the righteous, the overthrow of the living wicked, and the carrying into postponement the non-resurrection of the wicked dead until the close of the one thousand years; 
>
>Millennial, 
>as it affects the establishment of the Kingdom, the restoration of the Jews, the apportioning of positions, the execution and progress of the divine government; 
>
>Post-Millennial, 
>when “the rest of the dead,” and Satan himself, are judged.

>Obs. 1. Those who apply this passage to a general assize can only do so by taking for granted two suppositions, which are, in order to make out their sense, engrafted upon it. 
>(1) It is supposed that the “all nations” mean “all the generations of men that ever existed but this is a mere inference, and, being unproven, is a mere begging of the question.
