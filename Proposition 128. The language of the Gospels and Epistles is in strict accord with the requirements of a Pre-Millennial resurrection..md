# Proposition 128. The language of the Gospels and Epistles is in strict accord with the requirements of a Pre-Millennial resurrection.

### Righteous dead and wicked dead are raised - but not together
>The res. of the saints being a distinctive one, belonging exclusively to them and no others, this feature of separation as to character and time is *always* preserved. Thus 
>(1) where a res. of the just and of the unjust is mentioned together, that of the just has precedence; 
>(2) expressions such as “the Son quickeneth whom He will,” “they that hear shall live,” etc., imply that not *all* shall be made alive; 
>(3) the promise of raising up His own at the last day specifically given to believers, implies that unbelievers shall not be raised at the same time; 
>(4) the res. of the righteous described alone, without any reference whatever to the wicked (as John 6:39, 40, 44, 54; 1 Cor. 15, and 1 Thess. 4), implies a separate and distinctive one; 
>(5) the titles given to the res. of the righteous imply the same, as “the better resurrection,” “the res. of the just,” “the res. unto life.”
>p. 300-301 Vol. 2 Prop. 128 Obs. 8 slightly reformatted

>it is impossible to find a specific account of the resurrection of the wicked taking place *at the same time* with that of the righteous.
>p. 302 Vol. 2 Prop. 128 Obs. 10

>The reader is referred to the Covenant, and, as we have shown (Prop. 49), its fulfilment is *utterly impossible without a resurrection*.
>p. 302 Vol. 2 Prop. 128 Obs. 14

>If Christ and His saints are to reign *as predicted* over this restored people, etc., *then*, as a matter of course, this res. must take *precedence*, just as the Prophets locate it.
>p. 305 Vol. 2 Prop. 128 Obs. 15

>The res. and the throne and Kingdom of David *are inseparable*, and the former must, to meet the Divine Plan as revealed, *precede* the latter; and in this the Prophets *agree* (Prop. 126).
>p. 305 Vol. 2 Prop. 128 Obs. 15

>The doctrine of such a first res. presents motives such as no other can, explanatory of Paul’s desire to attain unto it. The reign with Christ, and distinguishing honor and blessedness are connected with it. It gives us an explanation of the martyr spirit of the early Church, and the earnest desires expressed to experience its power. Besides, it indicates how untrue and uncharitable are the deductions of infidels, and even others, that they were sustained and strengthened by a *false* belief.
>p. 305 Vol. 2 Prop. 128 Obs. 16

>This first resurrection being an eclectic one, separate and pertaining to those accounted worthy of attaining to the privileges of “the first-born,” it indicates *a previous judgment*. To insure a first res. (or a translation) there must be a corresponding fitness, and therefore this res. itself is evidence of the Divine acceptance of the person experiencing its power. An antecedent estimate of character and worthiness must, of necessity, exist. This is based on justifying faith which releases from condemnation and insures eternal life through Jesus; while the position and honor of the saint after resurrection is graduated by the works done in his life of faith.
>p. 306 Vol. 2 Prop. 128 Obs. 19

>we confess to *a gratification* that our faith is that of the Primitive Church on this point.
>p. 309 Vol. 2 Prop. 128 Obs. 22

>... our system of interpretation opens *no door* of entrance to the many conflicting and dangerous errors respecting the resurrection. Many, taking the weapons ready forged to hand by *a spiritualizing* interpretation of Isaiah, Ezekiel, and John, turn them *against* a literal resurrection of the dead. Work after work could be mentioned which has done this, jubilantly quoting from the orthodox the arguments for a figurative, moral, or ecclesiastical resurrection. This is only the *legitimate* developing of the Origenistic system of interpretation, an almost impregnable refuge for all forms of error. Now, in all those systems, which reduce the res. to an *incompleted redemption* of the body, or which refine it away into a mystical conception, etc., not one of them can, or does, appeal to us for deductions or aid, since *in no shape or form* do we give them the slightest countenance. Hence probably arises *the extreme hostility* manifested toward our system by various authors, because it is a standing rebuke to their own efforts at spiritualizing.
