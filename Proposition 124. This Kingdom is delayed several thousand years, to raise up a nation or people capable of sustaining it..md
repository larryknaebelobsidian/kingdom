# Proposition 124. This Kingdom is delayed several thousand years, to raise up a nation or people capable of sustaining it.

>It has been shown how the Kingdom failed in its Theocratic and Theocratic-Davidic establishment through the depravity of man, and how its re-establishment at the First Advent was rendered hopeless by the wickedness of the nation. Then a new feature in the plan of God appears, viz.: *to postpone* the Kingdom during a period called “the times of the Gentiles and during this season of delay gather out *a chosen people* to be associated in the re-establishment of the Kingdom on a firm and everlasting basis, beyond the reach, owing to the tested character, etc., of the rulers, of depravity (comp. Props. 59-65, 86, 87, 88, etc.).     
>p. 224 Vol. 2 Prop. 124
### Preparatory stage
>Obs. 1. Just as there was a preparatory growth and development of Abraham’s seed *before* the Theocratic government was instituted, so now there is designed and carried out by the Divine Will *a preparatory gathering* of Abraham’s seed until a sufficient, predetermined number is obtained. These are called *the Elect*. Made like unto Christ, when they appear with Him, they are “*joint heirs*” with Him.
>p. 224 Vol. 2 Prop. 124 Obs. 1
### Intermediate state
>Obs. 2. This view of the Kingdom sustains the doctrine of an intermediate state, in which, whatever the condition of the saints, they are waiting for the period of redemption, waiting for the crown and promised inheritance. (See Delitzsch, Sys. of Bib. Psyc., pp. 496, 498, 527-8.) This idea of the intermediate state is, however, not peculiar to our system, but belongs to various others. (Comp. Prop. 136.)

### Predetermined from the foundation of the world
>Obs. 3. The Kingdom itself is predetermined (Prop. 1) from the foundation of the world, so also (for all things fall under the Omniscient Will) is this preparatory gathering of Saints. In Eph. 1: “*He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world*,” just as Christ Himself “*was foreordained before the foundation of the world*” (1 Pet. 1:20).
>p. 224 Vol. 2 Prop. 124 Obs. 3
### Only after certain number gathered out
>Obs. 4. Until a certain number are gathered out to form the basis of rulership, guidance, etc., in this Kingdom, it is *vain*, owing to natural proneness to evil and to this Divine Plan for its correction, to expect its establishment under existing circumstances, or in this dispensation.
>p. 225 Vol. 2 Prop. 124 Obs. 4
### Joy of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob
>Obs. 5. We may well imagine the astonishment and joy of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, when this natural and engrafted seed is all gathered and occupy their allotted places in the Kingdom. The Prophets seem to make allusions to this, as e.g. Isa. 29:22, 23 (Alexander’s version); Isa. 49:18; 60:4, etc.
>p. 225 Vol. 2 Prop. 124 Obs. 5
### Passover fulfilled
>Obs. 6. Christ tells us that the Passover shall “*be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God*” Luke 22:16.
>...
>What was imperfectly realized in the removal from Egypt under Moses will be *perfectly* experienced under Jesus Christ, when He comes “*the second time unto salvation*” *viz., complete, realized redemption*.
>p. 225 Vol. 2 Prop. 124 Obs. 6
### Only introduced
>Obs. 7. Christ only introduces into His Kingdom those that He chooses, and, as Alexander’s version of Isa. 65:9, they are “*chosen ones*.”
