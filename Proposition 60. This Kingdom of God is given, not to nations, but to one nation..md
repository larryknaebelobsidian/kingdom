>This is distinctly stated, “a nation,” Matt. 21:43. It necessarily follows from our Scriptural propositions, and corroborates them. It is a logical sequence from the premises laid down. For, so long as one nation is chosen from among all others (Prop. 24), and the Kingdom is covenanted by oath to that nation (Prop. 49), it is impossible for other nations, in their national capacity, to be thus elected. It would be a violating of the most solemnly given covenants and assurances.
>p. 392 Vol. 1 Prop 60
### Must be related to Abraham
>Obs. 1. Notice: the Kingdom is promised to the natural believing descendants of Abraham, and as the nation, then existing when the Kingdom was offered, refused to repent in order to receive it, God must now—to carry out His purpose—raise up a nation unto Abraham, i.e. a nation in some way still related to him.

>Gentile nations cannot as nations be substituted for the one elect Jewish nation
>Obs. 1
### Wall of partition must be properly understood
>Obs. 2. In the consideration of this matter it is requisite for the reader to keep in mind what has been proven (see Props. 24,30, 49, 50, etc.), that the wall of partition between the Jewish nation, as such, and Gentile nations, as such, is not removed but only between believers of all nations and the Jewish nation. This is essential to a proper understanding of the truth, and is a feature clearly taught as already shown, over against the inferences of De Colanges (Ancient City), and many others.
### Abrahamic and Davidic covenants
>Obs. 3. The entire tenor of the Old and New Tests, makes the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants subsisting and continuous (Prop. 51); and the Divine Purpose in reference to salvation and the Kingdom is inseparably (Prop. 50) identified with them.
### God does not change His plan
>Obs. 4. God does not change His Plan of having one nation (comp. e.g. 1 Pet. 2:9) identified with Abraham, in which is lodged the foundation of that Kingdom destined to attain world-wide dominion, and to bring all nations directly under its sway.
### God's plan includes the required number in the briefest time compatible with the free agency of man
>From this we infer, that the Proposition contains a Plan adopted by the wisdom of God, by which not only the required number of the elect is obtained in the soonest manner, but that it contains within itself the elements by which “*the sure mercies of David*,” and all the covenanted promises, will be realized *in the briefest time compatible with the free agency of man*.
>p. 394 Vol. 1 Prop 60 Obs 5
### The one Jewish nation composed of individuals out of all nations
>It is extremely satisfactory to find that nowhere in the Scripture does the now prevailing view, that the Gentile nations, *as nations*, are called, find *the least* support This is precisely what the covenanted Word requires. This one nation to whom the Kingdom is to be given, which shall inherit it, is composed of individuals *out of all nations*. To no one Gentile nation is the Kingdom offered as *it was* to the Jewish, viz.: that on their national repentance the Kingdom of God would be established among or within it. This *could not* be done without doing violence to pledged covenants, seeing that the Theocratic-Davidic throne and Kingdom pertains *nationally* to the Jewish nation. But God can tender this Kingdom, on certain conditions, to individuals of all nations; and therefore all nations are invited in their individual capacity to receive the gospel and by the obedience of faith secure, through believing ones, the blessings of the Kingdom; i.e. in the persons thus believing a nation” will be gathered to whom the Kingdom will be given.
>p. 394 Vol. 1 Prop 60 Obs 6
### Gentile nations are not better than the Jewish nation
>Obs. 7. It is proper to remind the reader that this bestowal of a Kingdom to “a nation” that is to be gathered does not result from Gentile nations being better than the Jewish nation; It arises solely from the mercy and favor of God, who, out of the Jewish and Gentile nations alike, is ready and willing to accept of believers in Christ to form that nation to whom the Kingdom is to be given.
### Not nationalized churches
>Obs. 8. It may be added, that this feature throws light upon the question of nationalized churches as representative of the Kingdom of God.
