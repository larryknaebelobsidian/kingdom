>This is distinctly stated, “a nation,” Matt. 21:43. It necessarily follows from our Scriptural propositions, and corroborates them. It is a logical sequence from the premises laid down. For, so long as one nation is chosen from among all others (Prop. 24), and the Kingdom is covenanted by oath to that nation (Prop. 49), it is impossible for other nations, in their national capacity, to be thus elected. It would be a violating of the most solemnly given covenants and assurances.
>p. 392 Vol. 1 Prop 60

>From this we infer, that the Proposition contains a Plan adopted by the wisdom of God, by which not only the required number of the elect is obtained in the soonest manner, but that it contains within itself the elements by which “*the sure mercies of David*,” and all the covenanted promises, will be realized *in the briefest time compatible with the free agency of man*.
>p. 394 Vol. 1 Prop 60 Obs 5

>It is extremely satisfactory to find that nowhere in the Scripture does the now prevailing view, that the Gentile nations, *as nations*, are called, find *the least* support This is precisely what the covenanted Word requires. This one nation to whom the Kingdom is to be given, which shall inherit it, is composed of individuals *out of all nations*. To no one Gentile nation is the Kingdom offered as *it was* to the Jewish, viz.: that on their national repentance the Kingdom of God would be established among or within it. This *could not* be done without doing violence to pledged covenants, seeing that the Theocratic-Davidic throne and Kingdom pertains *nationally* to the Jewish nation. But God can tender this Kingdom, on certain conditions, to individuals of all nations; and therefore all nations are invited in their individual capacity to receive the gospel and by the obedience of faith secure, through believing ones, the blessings of the Kingdom; i.e. in the persons thus believing a nation” will be gathered to whom the Kingdom will be given.
