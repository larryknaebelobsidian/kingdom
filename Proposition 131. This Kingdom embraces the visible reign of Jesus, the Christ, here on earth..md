# Proposition 131. This Kingdom embraces the visible reign of Jesus, the Christ, here on earth.

>the entire analogy of prediction demands a visible reign.

>Obs. 1. So distinctly is this taught that no Jew, no Christian believer, no one who read the Scriptures doubted this, until the Alexandrian system evolved a series of doctrines, under the notion of exalting the truth and the Son, in which the throne promised to David’s Son was transformed into a throne in the third heaven.

>Obs. 2. Having in previous Propositions shown with sufficient distinctness that David’s Son, Jesus in His humanity, mast, if the prophecies are fulfilled, appear in a visible reign; that He does thus manifest Himself to the sight of all, it is unnecessary (as coming Propositions will materially add reasons for our doctrine to those already given) to enter into a detailed argument, since it is nowhere asserted that the visibility thus exhibited shall ever be withdrawn, withdrawn, and since the denial of such a visible reign is one of pure inference. No one, that we are aware of, has ever yet presented a passage of Scripture to prove the invisibility of the reign in the future.

>Obs. 3. To indicate how persons in their eagerness to deny a visible, personal reign on earth of Christ allow themselves to use unwarranted language (even to deny the personal return to the earth), language which they themselves contradict, we refer e.g. to Barnes, Com. on 1 Thess. 4:16, where in his remarks he says: “There is no intimation here of ‘a personal reign’ of Christ upon earth. Indeed, there is no evidence that He will return to the earth at all,” and then he proceeds to place Christ, the saints, the wicked, the living, and the dead in “the regions of the air.” This sounds very much like one of the old monkish legends, and is unworthy of so able a man.

>Neither Barnes nor any other writer has been able to adduce a single passage to support their theory of Christ’s Sec. Advent and .immediate return to heaven.
>Obs. 3

>Obs. 4. In the discussion of this personal return and reign it is saddening to find good persons placing themselves on the judgment seat, and dogmatically deciding what it is possible or impossible for God to perform.

>Obs. 5. It becomes painful to notice, in the objections levelled against us, the serious and unfounded change of “carnal, “fleshly,” etc.

>Obs. 6. Briefly, the feeble efforts at presenting proof against us drawn from Scripture

>Thus e.g. a comparison of Covenant, Zech. 14, Dan. 7, Isa. 25, and Rev. 20:1-6, is alone sufficient to decide the kind of reign intended.
>Obs. 6

>Obs. 7. Some (esteemed brethren) who frankly admit and earnestly advocate the Pre-Millennial Personal Advent, still express themselves timidly, illogically, and unscripturally in reference to the personal reign of Christ here on the earth.

>Some few advocating, after His Sec. Advent, His withdrawal to the third heaven, from whence He reigns (some stating that He may occasionally visit the earth and appear to men); others have a withdrawal into the air or upper regions, or into the New Jerusalem, also located in the air or above the earth.
>Obs. 7

>The central point of the Davidic Covenant is this: that Christ, as David’s Son, the promised seed, shall reign on David’s throne and in David’s Kingdom; and therefore the very language on the face of it conveys the important notion, that in consequence of this, He, as David’s Son and Lord, must be and is visibly present
>Obs. 7

>The Divine in Christ, whatever it may perform in the exercise of Divine Sovereignty in the universe, is associated with “the man ordained” to exhibit a perfect, visible Theocratic government Let us repeat: Christ is not to come again simply as the Son of God (that relationship to the Father is indeed indispensably requisite to make provision for salvation, to perfect it, and to establish the Theocracy in a permanent form), but pre-eminently and significantly (as the repeated promises to and name of Son of Man fully indicate) as the Son of ’Man, for the latter is the relationship specifically demanded in the Covenant to be visibly shown and acknowledged to be such by all.
>Obs. 7
