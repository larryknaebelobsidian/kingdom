### Previous arguments support the certainty of the plan
>Obs. 1. Our argument proves that the covenants, the prophecies, the continued incarnate relationship of Jesus—in brief, all that has been thus far advanced—clearly show that God will not fail in His Theocratic Plan —His proposed Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom.
### Is God unable to finish the job?
>Shall this ever be said of God, that He undertook a work that He cannot accomplish, or that the sinfulness of man defeated His ultimate purpose, or that, unable to proceed in a set purpose, He changed His Plan to accommodate Himself to human imperfection. No! when God undertakes a work, we may well abide His own time for its accomplishment.
>Obs. 2
### Not the church
>Obs. 3. The Church does not meet, as we have previously shown, the conditions of the Theocracy.
>...
>the early Church (more logical and consistent) believed, is only preparatory to the Theocracy.
### God has promised, how can it fail?
>Obs. 4. God has instituted, as something pertaining to Himself, a Theocratic ordering; He has embraced this in a covenant, confirmed its certainty by oath, reiterated His determination again and again to have it realized, instituted a series of preparations having decided reference to this end—how can then the restoration of the Theocracy prove a failure?
### Not the Pope
>Obs. 5. The nearest approach to this Theocratic rule by a representative, is that afforded by the Roman Church, in its professed vicegerent, the Pope. But this, notwithstanding its claims, power, etc., is an arrogant imitation and assumption of the rights and privileges of the Son of Man, David’s Son.
### Infidels argument
>Obs. 6. If we are never to see this Theocratic-Davidic Kingdom re-established under the covenanted seed, and the glorious predictions of the prophets realized in it, then God’s direct rule, in its Theocratic outward manifestations, has borne but little sway in this earth. Infidels, keen-scented, have seized this very feature, and used it as an argument against the Bible.
